The digital platform recommends\na selection of features based on project-specific parameters that can be further defined and refined by the project team.\nPERFORMANCE VERIFIED FEATURES\nWELL is a performance-based system. Every WELL project is verified through on-site testing of building performance. This practice\nis fundamental to high-performing buildings and helps project teams better understand the relationship between the physical\nenvironment and human health. \nThe process for on-site assessments and testing is called Performance Verification. On-site measurements are taken for various air\nand water quality parameters, as well as sound and light levels. It is a distinct process from traditional building commissioning and\nassures that the building performs as intended, according to WELL requirements.\nPerformance Verification is completed by an authorized WELL Performance Testing Agent, who usually spend one to three days in\nthe building to validate the project's documentation and complete a series of performance tests, spot-checks and measurements\ncovering all WELL concepts. Testing is completed according to IWBI's sampling protocols available in the WELL Performance\nVerification Guidebook.\nPROJECT TYPES\nWELL v2 projects fall into one of two main groups, determined primarily by ownership type: \nOwner-occupied: The project is mainly occupied by the project owner (which may be different than the building owner).\nWELL Core: The project owner occupies a small portion of the project area and rents/leases most of the space to one or more tenants.\n \nOwner-occupied Projects\nOwner-occupied projects are owned or leased by the project owner, and regular occupants (e.g., employees) are affiliated with\nthe project owner. Owner-occupied projects are awarded WELL Certification at the Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum level (see\nScoring and Certification Levels below).\nInteriors represent a particular case of owner-occupied projects, where the project owner rents/leases space within a larger\nbuilding (the \"base building\") that is less than half the size of the base building. Interiors projects operate like other owner-\noccupied projects, but in some cases, they can receive credit for amenities within the base building (see Project Boundary below).\nIn other instances, interiors projects may be required to collaborate or work with the building owner or landlord to meet feature\nrequirements that apply to building systems or spaces outside of the project owner's control, such as the HVAC system. \nWELL Core Projects\nWELL Core is a distinct pathway for core and shell buildings (also known as base buildings) seeking to implement fundamental\nfeatures to benefit tenants. In these projects, the majority of regular occupants are not affiliated with the project owner. Any\nbuilding type can register for WELL Core, provided that at least 75% of the project area is occupied by one or more tenants and/or\nserves as common space in the building accessible to all tenants. Note that offices affiliated with the project owner but unrelated\nto the management of the project property may be considered a tenant, as long as additional tenants unaffiliated with the project\nowner occupy at least 60% of the net leased area. WELL Core projects are awarded WELL Core Certification at the Bronze, Silver,\nGold or Platinum level (see Scoring and Certification Levels, below)\nMixed-use buildings where WELL Core is appropriate for at least 60% of the project area may register the entire building for WELL\nCore. Areas operated/occupied by the project owner are considered \"non-leased space\" (see Scope and Applicability below). Non-\nleased spaces include the common areas of the building and private spaces directly under the control of the building management\nteam. Mixed-use buildings where WELL Core is appropriate for less than 60% of the project area should register one or more\nportions of the building as individual projects for WELL Certification or WELL Core Certification, as appropriate.\nFeature Applicability and Scoring\nFeatures have varying scopes of applicability for WELL Core projects, depending on the relevant population and project area. For\nexample, some features, such as daylighting (L05) or bicycle storage (V04), must be met across the entire building. Other features\napply only to spaces or personnel under the purview of the project owner, such as offering healthcare (C06) or childcare (C10)\nbenefits.\nApplicability designations are defined as follows:\nPage 3 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nBuilding Management Staff: Individuals responsible for maintaining and operating the building, including contractors and sub-contractors. Workers who spend less than 30 hours per\nmonth in the building (i.e., who are not regular occupants) are not considered building management staff.\nDirect Staff: Building staff under direct employment by the project owner. Note: If a project has no direct staff on-site (i.e., the building is entirely operated by contracted building\nmanagement staff), the project is allowed to earn points by meeting feature requirements for all or a defined subset of building management staff. Projects must use a single consistent\npopulation across all features, including preconditions (e.g., a project with no direct staff may only earn a point for meeting an optimization for its building management staff, if it also\nmeets all preconditions for that same group of people).\nExtent of Developer Buildout: Includes all non-leased space and all construction within the leased space for which the project team is responsible.\nLeased Spaces: All areas within the project boundary that are leased to or owned by tenants, including areas for lease or for sale that are not currently occupied. \nNon-leased Spaces: All areas within the project boundary that are not considered leased space.\nProject owner: The legal entity that controls the property through ownership or as a leasee. \nWhole Building: Includes all areas within the project boundary. Some features indicate that projects can achieve a feature by providing a tenant budget. To use this pathway, project\nteams need to submit as part of documentation review, design assumptions and sample cut-sheets (as applicable) that justify the budget and can be used by the tenant during their\ndesign and construction process.\n \nWELL Core projects have different point-values for parts and features than owner-occupied projects, based on the extent to\nwhich the requirements benefit all occupants within the project. Features that must be met for the whole building are generally\nworth more for WELL Core, while features with no or limited effect on tenants are generally reduced in value. \nSome features allow WELL Core projects to earn additional points for applying the feature requirements in leased spaces (tenant\nareas) in addition to non-leased spaces. In addition, for projects where non-leased space makes up 40% or more of the project\narea, the additional point for some features (if indicated in the Core notes) may be earned without extending requirements to non-\nleased space. Projects are only eligible for one additional point per feature. Further guidance on applicability and additional point-\nearning potential for WELL Core is provided in the digital standard. To view this guidance, be sure to select the “WELL Core” view in\nthe digital standard.  \nTo earn additional points, WELL Core projects should first meet the baseline requirements of the feature established in WELL Core\nguidance. The exception is projects that do not include direct staff and/or non-leased space within their scope; these projects\nmay earn both the base points and additional points by meeting the requirements outlined in the additional point opportunity. To\nactivate in their scorecard, projects will select the base point and the additional point from the dropdown menu.\nPerformance Testing Scope\nFor WELL Core projects, at least 2.5% of the total building floor area must be available for performance testing for certain\npreconditions. The available testing area must include all common areas and spaces directly under the control of the building\nmanagement team. If common areas and spaces under owner control comprise less than 2.5% of the total building floor area, the\nproject must supplement with tenant spaces to reach this threshold. Testing in leased spaces in these cases can take place before\nor after tenant occupancy.\nSome performance-based optimizations explicitly state that they require testing in tenant spaces to be awarded. The project is\nresponsible for identifying and communicating to Green Business Certification, Inc. (GBCI) and the WELL Performance Testing\nAgent the particular spaces which are available for testing.\nMultifamily Residential Projects\nMultifamily residential projects may pursue WELL if they contain at least five dwelling units in a single building with common\nstructural elements. Projects that qualify include apartments, condominiums, townhouses and other residential complexes within\nall market thresholds – affordable housing, market-rate and luxury.\n \nMultifamily residential projects utilize the WELL Certification pathways (i.e., not WELL Core), even though most of the regular\noccupants are tenants, and the project owner may not complete the fit-out of the dwelling units. Any items installed by residents\nare not within scope of feature requirements, but do note that these items could impact performance testing results for other\nfeatures.\n \nPage 4 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

{"feature": "A01", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 6, "content": "Performance testing within dwelling units for precondition features is not required for multifamily residential projects seeking\ncertification at the Bronze or Silver level. However, projects cannot achieve Gold or Platinum without testing conditions in a\nsample of dwelling units. See Features A01, W01, W02, L02 and T01 and the Sampling Rates for Multifamily Residential section of\nthe WELL Performance Verification Guidebook for more details. For optimizations, testing within dwelling units is required,\nwhether or not the project is targeting Gold or Platinum. \n \nAt recertification, for all levels of certification, testing is not required within dwelling units -- only in common areas and spaces\ndedicated to building management. \nSCORING AND AWARDS\nWELL CERTIFICATION \nCertification represents the highest pinnacle of health achievement across all 10 concepts. Projects must achieve all\npreconditions, as well as a certain number of points towards different levels of WELL Certification:\nTotal points\nachieved\nWELL Certification\nWELL Core Certification\nMinimum\npoints per\nconcept\nLevel of\ncertification\nMinimum\npoints per\nconcept\nLevel of certification\n40 pts\n0\nWELL Bronze\n0\nWELL Core Bronze\n50 pts\n1\nWELL Silver\n0\nWELL Core Silver\n60 pts\n2\nWELL Gold\n0\nWELL Core Gold\n80 pts\n3\nWELL Platinum\n0\nWELL Core Platinum\n \nProjects may earn no more than 12 points per concept and no more than 100 points total across the ten concepts. \nProjects can also pursue an additional ten points in the Innovation concept. If a project earns more than 12 points in any concept,\nthe additional points are counted toward Feature I01, provided the maximum points in the Innovation concept have not yet been\nreached.\nPRECERTIFICATION\nWELL Precertification allows project owners to demonstrate a commitment to health and well-being, market the proposed\nfeatures of a project to potential tenants looking to occupy the space and determine which features the project is likely to achieve\nduring the full WELL Certification review. Unlike WELL Certification – which applies to a completed project – projects still under\nconstruction may achieve precertification, using documentation based on current plans rather than as-built conditions. In\naddition, performance testing results are not applicable/required during precertification.\nWELL Precertification requires achievement of all preconditions as well as 40 points in optimizations. Above this minimum, the\nprecertification designation does not further differentiate how many points are successfully reviewed (e.g., there is no “Precertified\nGold”).\nWELL SCORE\nOrganizations that subscribe their entire organization (or legal entity) are eligible to receive a WELL Score, a metric that reflects the\nhealth and well-being achievements of the entire organization. The WELL Score is a whole number ranging from 0 to 100, which is\ncalculated as the average number of points achieved by the project locations within the organization, weighted by the number of\noccupants in each location.\nPreconditions are not allocated points, but projects that have not met all preconditions contribute a maximum of 49 points\ntoward the WELL Score, even if they have achieved more than 49 points through optimizations. \nAPPLYING WELL FEATURES\nTo accurately define the project scope and determine which features apply or may be appropriate for a project, it is important to\nunderstand how WELL features apply to different spaces and populations within a building.\nPage 5 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

{"feature": "M09", "page_start": 7, "page_end": 7, "content": "PROJECT BOUNDARY\nDefining the boundary of the project pursuing WELL certification, or the borders of the project brings further specificity to the\nproject's scope. The project boundary must be consistently applied across all features. The project boundary may not\nunreasonably exclude portions of the building, space or site to give the project an advantage in complying with feature\nrequirements. The project must accurately communicate the scope of the project in all promotional and descriptive materials and\ndistinguish it from any space that falls outside of the project boundary. The project pursuing WELL certification should be defined\nby a clear boundary, such that the project is physically distinct from any portion of spaces not part of the project pursuing WELL\ncertification. \nThe project boundary can include both interior and exterior spaces. Note that if the project boundary includes exterior (outdoor)\nspaces, this area is not counted when determining the project's area at registration (including for pricing purposes). For more\nguidance on how to calculate project size, download the WELL Certification Guidebook.\nWELL features (unless otherwise noted in feature language) must be met within the project boundary, including (if applicable)\nexterior space. One of the pathways in Feature M09 Part 2 requires that projects provide an occupant-accessible outdoor space.\nFor this space to count, it must be within the project boundary and, therefore, within the scope of other features that affect\noutdoor areas, such as pest management and pesticide use in Feature X10 (if pursued) and illuminance levels on pathways for\nFeature L02. \nProject Boundary Allowances\nSome features explicitly enable a space within a certain distance of the project boundary to be used towards feature requirements.\nFeature language specifies the distance allowed for each strategy. For example, Feature N08 requires a designated eating space\nwithin a 200 m [650 ft] walk distance of the project boundary. In these cases, the distance is measured along a pedestrian-\naccessible path from a functional building entrance (elevation change should not be considered in its calculation). If located\noutside of the project boundary, the space is not subject to the requirements of other features pursued by the project. These\nspaces may also be provided within the project boundary, in which case they are subject to other WELL requirements. \nCertain features include a certification note for interiors projects that enable them to claim credit for amenities provided by their\nbase building outside the project boundary. For example, an interior fit-out project may use the stairs which connect the entrance\nto the ground floor (if occupant-accessible) toward Feature V03. If a feature prescribes a certain quantity of amenities (such as the\nnumber of long-term bicycle parking spaces in Feature V04), an interiors project may take credit for the base building meeting this\nfeature as long as these amenities are either reserved for the WELL project or sized for all occupants in the building. \nSPACE TYPES\nAll parts of WELL v2 are designated for specific space types. Space types refer to spaces within a project and not the project as a\nwhole. For example, a school might be made up of space types like classrooms, offices, a commercial kitchen and dining areas.\nIdentifying space types within a project can help clarify how WELL features apply to that particular project. \nMany parts in WELL features are denoted \"For All spaces,\" an indication the part must be applied to all spaces within the project\nboundary, for all project types. Depending on the part, there may be distinct requirements for specific space types. These\nrequirements are either required in addition to the requirements for all spaces or used in place of the requirements listed for all\nother spaces. For example, Feature N01 Part 1 has separate requirements for dining spaces and all other spaces, as indicated in the\ntab, \"For All Spaces except Dining Spaces.\" Conversely, Feature N01 Part 2 has one set of requirements \"For All Spaces\" (including\nDining Spaces) and additional requirements \"For Dining Spaces\" only. \nSpace Type Occupancy\nIn addition to the classification of space types within a project, WELL v2 also distinguishes spaces based on their level of\noccupancy: \nRegularly occupied space: areas inside the project where a particular individual normally spends at least one continuous hour or, cumulatively, at least two hours per day, such as offices,\nconference rooms, bedrooms and classrooms.\nOccupiable space: spaces that can be occupied for any task or activity, including transition areas or balconies, but excluding spaces that are rarely accessed, such as storage spaces or\nequipment rooms. \n \nRooms larger than 930 m  [10,000 ft ] may be divided into separate zones (at least 325 m  [3,500 ft ] each), which may be\n2\n2\n2\n2\nPage 6 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

{"feature": "V02", "page_start": 8, "page_end": 11, "content": "evaluated for occupancy independently. For example, a large room may have one or more small areas (i.e., zones) within it, which\nare regularly occupied, while the remaining space is not. In this case, the project may identify and label these zones within their\nfloor plan and apply features and performance testing requirements accordingly. \n \nOCCUPANT TYPES\nDetermining or anticipating who will be present in each phase of a project helps create a complete picture of where and for whom\nthe requirements of WELL features apply. WELL uses specific terminology to refer to groups of individuals that share\ncharacteristics. Project teams must employ a single, consistent definition of these terms across relevant features:\nOccupant: any individual within the project boundary.\nRegular occupant: an individual who spends at least 30 hours per month across at least five days within the project boundary (e.g., employee, resident, student).\nVisitor: any occupant who is not a regular occupant (e.g., shopper, museum-goer, hotel guest).\nEmployee: an individual who works for the project owner within the project boundary. \nEligible employee: an employee identified as qualifying for benefits. At a minimum, this includes all full-time employees but may also include part-time employees, interns, contracted\nworkers and other non-full-time employees as appropriate.\nFor features that require size or quantity calculations to be performed based on a class of occupants listed in feature language, use\nthe maximum number of occupants of that class to be expected at any given time.\nCALCULATIONS\nWhen making calculations for WELL features, do not apply rounding. Instead, use the most expansive interpretation of the result.\nFor example, Feature V02 Part 1 requires adjustable height workstations for \"at least 25% of all workstations.\" In a project with 21\nworkstations, the required number of workstations would be six, since five desks would only reach 23.8%.\nMINIMUM SCOPE OF WELL FEATURES\nCertain features require that a minimum scope is met – that is, the minimum level of achievement necessary to achieve a feature\nrelated to people, spaces and/or products. \nNEWLY INSTALLED PRODUCTS\nSome features, particularly in the Materials concept, require that products (such as cleaning products) with specific characteristics\nor qualities be used or installed in the project. More specifically, the requirements of some features apply to newly installed\nproducts -- that is, products installed after project registration. \nPreconditions have no minimum scope, and a project without any relevant newly installed materials/products is considered in\ncompliance. For example, Feature X01 restricts mercury in specific categories of newly installed lamps and electronics. If a project\ninstalls no lamps or electronics, they are considered in compliance with feature requirements. \nFor projects to qualify for optimizations that apply to newly installed products or materials, the quantity of products or materials\nwhich must comply with feature requirements is specified in the feature language. For example, Feature X05 requires that at least\nhalf of newly installed furniture, millwork and fixtures meet the enhanced material restrictions, and there must be at least 10\ndistinct products within the scope to qualify. \nFOODS AND BEVERAGES\nA particular category of products pertains to foods and beverages. Projects that do not sell or provide food daily by (or under\ncontract with) the project owner, including catering, are considered in compliance with the Nourishment preconditions. A daily\nbasis is defined as the majority of days in the project's operating week. This is assessed during each week of seasonal operation for\nPage 7 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nprojects that do not sell or provide food year-round.\nFoods and beverages supplied by the project owner (or by a vendor under contract with the project owner) include but are not\nlimited to items sold or provided in restaurants, cafeterias, cafes, vending machines and items available in kitchen pantry areas.\nThey do not include anything brought into the project by occupants for personal consumption. \nFeatures that apply to commercial dining spaces require on-site food preparation and/or full-service dining. These projects\ntypically include a commercial kitchen and food service staff. Foods prepared on-site include foods assembled on-site and foods\nprepared for immediate consumption. Projects without these facilities are not eligible to pursue these features. \nPage 8 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

During this time, inhalation exposure to indoor air pollutants can lead to a variety of negative short-\nand long-term health and well-being outcomes that can vary in severity. Less severe symptoms of exposure can\ninclude headaches, dry throat, eye irritation or runny nose, while more severe health outcomes can include asthma\nattacks, infection with Legionella bacteria and carbon monoxide poisoning.\n In the U.S. alone, indoor pollution\ncontributes to thousands of cancer deaths and hundreds of thousands of respiratory health issues annually.  In\naddition to public health concerns, estimates by the U.S. EPA suggest that net avoidable costs associated with indoor\nair pollution amount to well over $100 billion annually with 45% of those costs attributable to avoidable deaths from\nradon and environmental tobacco smoke, about 45% from lost productivity and about 10% from avoidable respiratory\ndiseases.\nThe most common indoor air contaminants are combustion sources, such as candles, tobacco products, stoves,\nfurnaces and fireplaces, that release pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and small particles into\nthe air.  Building materials, furnishings, fabrics, cleaning products, personal care products and air fresheners can also\nall emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) into the indoor\nenvironment.\nAchieving the goal of clean indoor air requires both professionals and building users to engage not just in the\nconversation but also in the implementation of adequate approaches. Although indoor air quality can be managed\nprimarily through eliminating the sources of air pollution and through adequate design solutions and human behavior\nmodification\n, some WELL features require installation of a specific treatment method or technology. \nIt is evident that the impact of improving indoor air quality is substantial . In a recent global burden of disease study,\nhousehold air pollution was rated as the tenth most important cause of ill health for the\nworld’s population.\n Furthermore, The World Health Organization estimated that, globally, air pollution contributed\nto approximately seven million premature deaths in 2012.\n Around 600,000 of those were children under 5 years\nold.\n The WELL Air Concept seeks to implement holistic design strategies to promote clean air and minimize human\nexposure to harmful contaminants, in order to maximize benefits to productivity, well-being and health.\nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Air Concept.

They have\nestablished permissible levels for such criteria pollutants based on epidemiological studies that show the relationships between concentrations of these pollutants, duration of exposure\nand health risks. Achieving the goal of clean indoor air as defined by permissible levels, requires the joint efforts of both professionals and building users in the implementation of\nadequate approaches. Indoor air quality can be properly managed through different features listed in the WELL Air concept, including source control strategies, passive and active\nbuilding design and operation strategies and human behavior interventions. Effective mechanical ventilation is particularly effective at bringing radon below acceptable thresholds.6,7\nPART 1 MEET THRESHOLDS FOR PARTICULATE MATTER\nFor All Spaces except Commercial Kitchen Spaces & Industrial:\nOption 1: Acceptable thresholds\nThe following thresholds are met in occupiable spaces:\na.

Ingredients in cigarettes form over 7,000\ncompounds when burned, of which at least 69 are known to be carcinogenic.  As a result, the average life expectancy of a smoker is 10 years less than that of a\nnonsmoker.  Furthermore, secondhand smoke exposes nonsmokers to the same contaminants, increasing  the number of people subject to health risks from smoking. The thirdhand\nsmoke (residual chemicals left on indoor surfaces by tobacco smoke) clings to walls, furniture, clothing, bedding, carpets and other surfaces, long after smoking has occurred. Emerging\nevidence suggests  that there are serious health consequences associated with exposure to thirdhand tobacco smoke,  secondhand marijuana smoke and emissions from  e-\ncigarettes.\n Health issues associated with tobacco smoke include asthma attacks, respiratory infections, coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and sudden infant death\nsyndrome.  Despite these adverse impacts on health, 80% of the global population lives in countries not protected by 100% smoke-free regulations.\nSolutions : There is no safe and acceptable level of cigarette smoke exposure.  Therefore, the only way to protect people from secondhand and thirdhand smoke is to implement a 100%\nsmoke-free environment.\n In order to prevent intrusion of cigarette smoke from the outdoors, projects must also take steps to ensure that smoking is not allowed in the vicinity of\nbuilding entrances, operable windows and building air intakes.\nPART 1 PROHIBIT INDOOR SMOKING\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirement is met:\na. Smoking and the use of e-cigarettes is prohibited in interior spaces within the project boundary.\nPART 2 PROHIBIT OUTDOOR SMOKING\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: No smoking signage\nThe following requirements are met:\na.   Clear and visible permanent signage prohibiting smoking and vaping is located within {{well-\nunit}}3 m|10 ft{{/well-unit}} of all functional building entrances, operable windows and building air intakes that\nopen to any occupiable outdoor area.\nb. Clear and visible permanent signage describing the hazards of smoking is located in all outdoor areas designated\nfor smoking and vaping.\nOption 2: No applicable outdoor spaces\nThe following are not present within the project boundary:\na. Any occupiable outdoor areas (e.g., decks, patios, balconies, rooftops, walkways)\nb. Functional building entrances.\nREFERENCES\n1. National Cancer Institute.

This is\ncollectively called sick building syndrome (SBS).\n Poor ventilation is also linked to increased rates of employee absences, higher operational costs for businesses and decreased\nproductivity in students.\nOne U.S.-based study reported that the sick leave attributable to insufficient provision of fresh air in buildings is estimated to be 35% of total\nabsenteeism.  Therefore, the economic costs of SBS in under-ventilated buildings are significant and far exceed the energy-related cost savings.\nSolutions : Many indoor and outdoor sources of air pollution emit particulate matter and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can cause discomfort and trigger asthma and eye, nose\nand throat irritation. In order to maintain healthy indoor environments and acceptable air quality for building users, it is necessary to provide sufficient ventilation.\n In addition to\nproper HVAC system design, mechanically ventilated projects need to perform regular system maintenance, since inadequate maintenance is associated with reduced ventilation\nperformance and a deterioration in indoor air quality and thermal conditions.  For naturally ventilated spaces, it is necessary to ensure that adequate outdoor air quality and noise levels\nare met.\nPART 1 ENSURE ADEQUATE VENTILATION\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Mechanically ventilated spaces\nFor mechanically ventilated buildings, one of the following requirements is met:\na.

Increased emissions of PM  in the vicinity of construction sites are positively correlated with people's suffering from respiratory\ndiseases.  Building construction and renovations are primarily a source of coarse particulate matter, but they are also a source of airborne ultrafine particles.\nSolutions : The indoor air quality levels can be compromised during building construction. Care should be taken during construction to prevent dust intrusion and/or to clear the space\nof dust, chemical vapors and other debris to avoid significant aggravation of indoor air quality. Air duct protection, moisture and dust management, filter replacement and proper\nequipment selection are strategies that improve indoor air quality, by limiting the exposure to an intense contamination period.\nPART 1 MITIGATE CONSTRUCTION POLLUTION\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Manage construction pollution\nFor construction occurring after enrollment or the start of subscription, the following requirements are met:\na. Ducts are maintained per one of the below:\n1. Ducts are sealed and protected from possible contamination during construction.\n2. Ducts are cleaned prior to installing registers, grills and diffusers.\nb. If permanently installed ventilation system is operating during construction, filters must meet the following: \n1. Media filters with an average removal efficiency of ≥ 70% for particles 3-10 µm in size (e.g., MERV 8, M5 or\nePM10 70%) are used to filter return air.\n2. All filters are replaced prior to occupancy.\nc.  The project implements the following moisture and dust management procedures:\n1. Carpets, acoustical ceiling panels, fabric wall coverings, insulation, upholstery and furnishings and other\nabsorptive materials are stored separately in a designated area protected from moisture damage.\n2. All active areas of work are isolated from other spaces by sealed doorways or windows or through the use of\ntemporary barriers.\n3. Walk-off mats are used at entryways to reduce the transfer of dirt and pollutants.\n4. Saws and similar tools use dust guards or collectors to capture generated dust.\nOption 2: No construction activities\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The project has not undergone construction activities after enrollment.\nREFERENCES\n1. Bergdahl IA, Torén K, Eriksson K, et al.

Researchers have also identified a clear relationship between indoor air quality and human productivity in buildings.  An average of 10% of productivity loss could be attributable\nto health issues related to poor indoor air quality in office buildings.  There is also an emerging body of evidence that air pollution can disrupt physical and cognitive development in\nchildren.  Studies have also shown that air pollution contributes to the large global burden of respiratory and allergic diseases, as well as the premature deaths of adults and\nchildren.  The premature mortality rate could be reduced by up to 15%, if PM\n is reduced from 70 to 20 µg/m .  As a result, enhanced air quality is positively correlated with improved\nhealth, cognitive and physical development, higher incomes and better economic performance.\n    \nSolutions : Indoor air quality can be properly managed primarily through source control strategies, passive and active building design and operation strategies and human behavior\nintervention. High levels of indoor air quality require both professionals and building users to collaborate in the implementation of adequate approaches.\nPART 1 MEET ENHANCED THRESHOLDS FOR PARTICULATE MATTER (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirement is met:\na.

Even with proper ventilation designed to meet ventilation standards, the concentration of indoor pollutants can exceed concentrations found in\noutdoor air.\nVentilation rates less than {{well-unit}}21 cfm|10 L/s{{/well-unit}} per person in all building types are associated with negative perception of air quality and actual health\noutcomes.\nSolutions : Scientific research suggests that an airflow rate significantly exceeding that recommended by standards is needed to minimize sick building syndrome symptoms and to\nimprove human performance and productivity.\n Since it is difficult to test for every potential pollutant, and because carbon dioxide (CO ) is easy to detect, CO  levels serve as a proxy\nfor other indoor pollutants. A number of CO  studies suggest that the risk of sick building syndrome symptoms decreases significantly, when CO  concentrations are less than\n800 ppm.  One method for decreasing the CO2 concentration experienced by occupants while minimizing additional energy use is demand-controlled ventilation, in which the delivery\nrate for outside air is directly linked to the measured CO2 levels within the space.  Displacement ventilation improves indoor air quality, by delivering fresh outdoor air at the floor level,\nleaving warmer polluted indoor air, such as CO  to be extracted above the height of the ventilation zone.\nPART 1 INCREASE OUTDOOR AIR SUPPLY (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Increased air supply\nFor mechanically ventilated buildings, the following requirement is met in all occupiable spaces:\na. Exceed outdoor air supply rates described in one of the ventilation guidelines listed in Feature A03 Part 1 by the\npercentages shown in the table below:\nTier\nThresholds\nPoints\n1\n30%\n{{well-points}} 1|2 {{/well-points}}\n2\n60%\n{{well-points}} 2|3{{/well-points}}\nOption 2: Demand control ventilation\nFor mechanically ventilated buildlings, the following requirements are met in at least 90% of regularly occupied\nspaces:\na. A demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) system regulates the outdoor air ventilation rate to keep CO  levels less\nthan the thresholds specified in the table below, at the maximum intended occupancy: \nTier\nThreshold\n \nThreshold\nPoints\n1\n900 ppm\nOR\n500 ppm above outdoor levels\n  {{well-points}} 1|2 {{/well-points}}\n2\n750 ppm\nOR\n350 ppm above outdoor levels\n{{well-points}} 2|3{{/well-points}}\nb. Carbon dioxide is measured at the return air diffusers or in the breathing zone at least {{well-unit}}3.3 ft|1\nm{{/well-unit}} away from doors, windows, air supply diffusers or occupants. At least one sensor is used for each\noccupancy zone (or per air handling unit, if a single zone is served by multiple air handling units). If the occupancy\ndensity/pattern/usage is substantially different in two adjacent areas, each area must be considered a separate\nzone.\nOption 3: Enhanced natural ventilation\nFor naturally ventilated buildings, the following requirement is met:\na. Implement an engineered natural ventilation system that is sufficient to keep CO  levels in the breathing zone of\nall regularly occupied spaces below the specified thresholds at the maximum intended occupancies:\nTier\nThreshold\n \nThreshold\nPoints\n1\n900 ppm\nOR\n500 ppm above outdoor levels\n{{well-points}} 1|2 {{/well-points}}\n2\n750 ppm\nOR\n350 ppm above outdoor levels\n{{well-points}} 2|3{{/well-points}}\nOption 4: Ventilation monitoring\nOne of the following carbon dioxide thresholds is met in occupiable spaces:\na. 750 ppm or less.\nb. Not more than 350 ppm above outdoor levels.\nNote : This Option is worth {{well-points}}2|3{{/well-points}} points. Refer to the Performance Verification Guidebook for information on sensor/testing requirements, required testing\nduration and compliance calculations.\n1\n2,3 \n4\n5,6\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n7\n2\n8\nOR\n2\nOR\n2\nOR\nPage 23 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNote : Mixed-mode projects must select the option corresponding to the ventilation mode (mechanical and natural\nventilation) in operation for the majority of operating hours within the year.\nPART 2 IMPROVE VENTILATION EFFECTIVENESS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Displacement ventilation system\nThe project uses a displacement ventilation system in at least 90% of regularly occupied spaces, with one of the\nfollowing as a basis for design:\na. ASHRAE Guidelines RP-949.\nb. ASHRAE 62.1-2019, \"Stratified Air Distribution Systems (Section 6.2.1.2.1).\nc. REHVA Guidebook No. 01 (Displacement Ventilation in non-industrial premises).\nOption 2: Personalized ventilation system\nAt least 50% of workstations incorporate personalized ventilation systems that meet the following requirements:\na. One of the following strategies is implemented to efficiently deliver air to occupants:\n1. Outdoor air is supplied in the breathing zone through vents incorporated into or mounted on furniture, and\nthe return air diffusers within the space are located at least {{well-unit}}9 ft|2.8 m{{/well-unit}} above the\nfloor.\n2. The system's zone air distribution effectiveness (E_z) is at least 1.20.\nb. One of the following strategies is implemented to support thermal comfort:\n1. Outdoor air is supplied with an air speed of no greater than {{well-unit}}50 fpm|0.25 m/s{{/well-unit}} at the\noccupant's head.\n2. The air speed from each outdoor air supply vent is individually controllable by occupants through a controller\nwithin the space, a mobile application or website.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Achieving natural ventilation through open windows\ncan provide a positive human experience.  However, it is challenging to the ability to maintain strict control over interior air quality. Despite often having conditions of temperature and\nventilation below recommended standards, studies have shown that naturally ventilated buildings have fewer people reporting sick building syndrome symptoms than mechanically\nconditioned buildings.\n In addition, studies have shown that there is a 7.7% productivity benefit associated with naturally ventilated spaces.\n   \nSolutions : When weather and local outdoor parameters indicate high-quality outdoor air, people should be encouraged to make use of natural ventilation strategies. However,\nventilating through windows generally introduces more outdoor pollution than mechanical systems with filters.  Human behavior is rated as one of the top three components affecting\nthe generation and persistence of indoor air pollutants.  Educating and informing building users when outdoor conditions are favorable for window opening, can reduce the generation\nand persistence of indoor air pollutants. \nPART 1 PROVIDE OPERABLE WINDOWS (MAX : 1 PT )\nNote :\nProjects where the average outdoor PM2.5 level is 35 µg/m³ or higher may only achieve Part 1: Provide Operable\nWindows in conjunction with Part 2: Manage Window Use. \nFor All Spaces:\nProject meets one of the below:\na.

For example, cooking in the home can lead to a rapid spike in indoor\nair pollution.  Urban rush hours and waste-burning cause spikes in air pollution outdoors, which can directly impact indoor air quality. Some indoor air pollutants are recognized by their\nimmediate impacts on our body, such as throat irritation or watery eyes.\n However others that go undetected, are not necessarily benign. According to the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency, some health impacts like respiratory diseases, heart disease and cancer can appear years after exposure.\nSolutions : Due to air quality fluctuations, it is important to install air quality sensors and detectors in every building. Because air quality can fluctuate throughout the day in every building,\nreal-time monitoring is necessary to promptly fix any deviations in indoor quality metrics and minimize occupant exposure to pollutants. In addition to having robust and calibrated\nsensors, positioning them correctly plays a crucial role in the accurate assessment of air quality.Furthermore, educating occupants about the risks associated with elevated air pollutant\nexposures, along with actions they can take to reduce these risks, can encourage personal agency to seek out opportunities to further curb indoor pollution levels.\nPART 1 INSTALL INDOOR AIR MONITORS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\n1: Sensor requirements\nThe project deploys monitors with sensors that measure at least three of the following parameters in occupiable\nspaces in compliance with the requirements outlined in the Continuous Monitoring Protocols of the Performance\nVerification Guidebook:\na.

Exposure to high levels of coarse and fine particulate matter inadvertently\nintroduced into the space can lead to respiratory irritation. It has been associated with increases in lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and mortality.  Indoor air quality and thermal\ncomfort can be compromised by leaks and gaps that break the building’s air barrier. These weak points are not only wasteful from an energy point of view but can also lead to conditions\nconducive to mold growth and to the infiltration of pests or polluted air. In addition, building users can introduce particulate matter indoors through their clothes and shoes, including\nharmful coliforms and Escherichia coli, among other toxins.\nSolutions : In addition to building envelope commissioning, there is a need for measures that minimize or prevent the introduction of potentially harmful substances into indoor spaces.\nAn example of such interventions is the installation of entryway walk-off systems and/or entryway air seals at all main building entrances.\nPART 1 DESIGN HEALTHY ENTRYWAYS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Building entry design\nFor any functional building entrance (not including doors to balconies or terraces), the following design features are\npresent:\na. At least one of the following strategies are in place at entryways that span, at minimum, the width of the entrance\nand {{well-unit}}10 ft|3 m{{/well-unit}} long in the primary direction of travel (sum of indoor and outdoor length):\n1. Grilles.\n2. Grates or slots.\n3. Rollout mats.\n4. Removable carpet tiles.\n5. Any other product designed to remove dirt from shoes at the entrance.\nb. At least one of the following strategies are in place to slow the movement of air from outdoors to indoors:\n1. Building entry vestibule with two typically closed doorways.\n2. Revolving entrance doors.\n3. Buildings with an entrance that is outside of the project boundary, or buildings with an entrance lobby that is\nnot regularly occupied, must have at least three typically shut doors that separate the outdoors from all\nregularly occupied spaces within the project boundary.\n4. Air curtains installed and commissioned in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2019.\n2: Building entry maintenance\nBuilding entryway systems are cleaned, as follows:\na. Wet-cleaned at least once a week, or as instructed by manufacturer.\nb. Vacuumed at least once a day, or as instructed by manufacturer.\nFor Outdoor Sport Areas:\nThe following requirement is met:\na. All facilities adjacent to an outdoor sports field have an area (e.g., staging area, mudroom, drying room) that\nseparates the playing field from other internal areas to capture moisture and debris.\nNote :\nInteriors projects may count exterior building entrances that meet the feature requirements, even if they are outside\nof the project boundary.\nPART 2 PERFORM ENVELOPE COMMISSIONING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFor projects undergoing design and construction, the following requirements are met:\na. The project uses a façade engineer that is responsible for defining the building envelope performance metrics\n(including materials, components, assemblies and systems) at the concept design stage. \nb. The building envelope performance requirements are included in the Basis of Design document and reflect the\nOwner's Project Requirements. \nc. The commissioning process includes envelope commissioning for air infiltration and leakage, which is reflected in\nthe specification and commissioning plan. \nd. The envelope commissioning process is executed, as outlined in the commissioning plan. \ne. The envelope commissioning plan is included in the project Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Manual.\nNote :\nInteriors projects may count commissioning performed on the building envelope, even if outside of the project\n1\n2\n3–5\n6\n7\nPage 29 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

PM\n can block and inflame airways, causing a range of respiratory-related conditions that\ncan lead to illness or death.  PM\n poses even greater health risks compared to PM\n because it can penetrate deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and as a result, cause a variety\nof health issues, including heart disease and other cardiovascular complications.\nSolutions : Selection and installation of adequate media filters is one of the key mechanisms for minimizing exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution. Studies have shown that\ndecreased exposure to particulate matter by filtration of recirculated indoor air is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and is an effective control measure for reducing\nallergic respiratory disease.\n In addition, regular filter maintenance is critical to ensure proper air filtration and the efficiency of the air conditioning system. During the operation, filters\nshould be replaced when they become loaded with particles, since they will begin to reduce airflow and increase pressure drop. Overloaded filters not only restrict airflow rate but can\nalso result in a loss of filtration efficiency. It is also critical for projects to be aware whether the building is located in an area with elevated outdoor air pollution, since these projects\noften need to install a pre-filtration stage, in addition to the primary filtration, to maintain high-quality indoor air.\nPART 1 IMPLEMENT PARTICLE FILTRATION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Filtration levels\nThe following requirement is met:\na. Media filters are used in the ventilation system to filter outdoor air supplied to the space, in accordance with\nthresholds specified in the table below:\n  Annual Average Outdoor PM\nThreshold  \n  Average Air Filtration Efficiency (particles 0.3-1 µm)  \n23 µg/m³ or less\n≥ 35% (e.g., MERV 12 or M6)\n24–39 µg/m³\n≥ 75% (e.g., MERV 14, F8 or ePM1 75%)\n40 µg/m³ or greater\n≥ 95% (e.g., MERV 16, E10 or ePM1 95%)\n2: Filter maintenance\nThe following requirement is met:\na.

When humans exhale, they can release pathogens, such as COVID-19 or Influenza particles, which can remain suspended in the air for several hours or longer. These\npathogens can be recirculated through ducts and HVAC systems of buildings, increasing the risk of transmission of disease indoors.\nSolutions : The simplest way to avoid recirculating contaminated air is to not recirculate it by supplying spaces with 100% outdoor air. Unfortunately, in certain climates this can result\nin high energy usage, although this can be mitigated through the use of heat recovery systems.  In buildings where recirculated air is utilized, it can be treated to remove contaminants.\nCarbon is capable of filtering VOCs and ozone from the air that passes through\n. HEPA or near-HEPA filters can help remove virus particles, since the virus often travels as an\nattachment to a larger particle.\n UVGI systems can also be effective, both when irradiating the upper portion of the room or when installed in the air ducts, so long as they are\npowerful and/or the air speed is slow enough to provide a sufficient UV dose.\n Other technologies exist, but should be evaluated carefully. For example, more novel devices that\nrelease oxidants into rooms have less robust evidence for safety and efficacy outside of laboratory conditions.\n Finally, in-room air purifiers can be beneficial because the clean air is\noften provided within the breathing zone. For optimal performance, air filtration systems need to be maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPART 1 IMPROVE SUPPLY AIR (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: 100% Outdoor air provisions\nThe following requirements are met:  \na. Each regularly occupied space is ventilated with outdoor air that has not recirculated from other rooms within the\nbuilding.\nOption 2: Cleaning and purification devices\nAll regularly occupied spaces with recirculated air are treated with purification/cleaning system(s), either in the HVAC\nsystem or as a standalone device, which meet the following requirements:\na.

Air conditioner systems, specifically cooling coils, have high levels of\nmoisture condensation and serve as the perfect breeding grounds for mold.  Mold developed on cooling coils may shed particles into the building’s indoor air and trigger asthma,\nheadaches, allergies and other respiratory system disorders.\n Exposure to mold has also been associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, lung tumor\ndevelopment, eczema and toxic mold syndrome.\nSolutions : The growth of microorganisms and mold can be prevented and mitigated through a combination of regular mold inspections and placement of microbe inactivation\ntechniques, such as Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) systems. Periodic inspections and maintenance of cooling systems are good preventative methods to reduce system failures\nthat contribute to an increased potential for mold proliferation. Expenses associated with proper maintenance will often offset typical costs associated with mold remediation.  UVGI has\nbeen shown to dramatically reduce mold and bacteria growth on cooling coils and destroy microbial films that accumulate on their surfaces.  Studies have also associated the\nimplementation of UVGI systems with a simultaneous reduction in viable microorganisms and respiratory disorders in the workplace.   \nPART 1 IMPLEMENT ULTRAVIOLET TREATMENT FOR HVAC SURFACES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: UV system design\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

All cooling coils and drain pans not associated with central air handling units (e.g., those used in fan coil units or\nsupplementary air handling units) either:\n1. Are irradiated by ultraviolet lamps.\n2. May be opened for inspection for mold growth and cleaned, if necessary.\n2: UV system maintenance and inspection\nThe following requirements are met:\na. Evidence that the ultraviolet lamps have been replaced or maintained, according to manufacturer's\nrecommendation is submitted annually through the WELL digital platform.\nb. All cooling coils without ultraviolet lamps (if applicable) are inspected on a quarterly basis for mold growth and\ncleaned if necessary.

It\nincludes features that address the availability and contaminant thresholds of drinking water, as well as features\ntargeting the management of water to avoid damage to building materials and environmental conditions.\nNearly two-thirds of the human body is composed of water; it is a major component of cells and the dominant\ncomponent of fluid between the cells.  Water is the medium for the transport of nutrients and waste throughout the\nbody and helps to regulate the internal body temperature.  Depending on age, sex and pregnancy status, guidelines\nfor water intake (including water in foods as well as direct consumption) recommend values between 2 and 3.7L daily\nwater consumption by adults.\n These amounts are appropriate to offset what leaves the body through respiration,\nperspiration and excretion, aiding in the removal of toxins, byproducts and other waste.  However, many people are\ninadequately hydrated, even where safe water is usually at the tap.\n One contributing factor to this is the real or\nperceived quality of drinking water, as people who mistrust the safety of their water can be more likely to have lower\nintake of water and higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.\nOver the last hundred years, many parts of the world saw dramatic improvements in drinking water quality that\ntriggered massive reductions in the prevalence of infectious diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention recognize this as one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20  century.  However, there\nhas been increasing risk from industrial, agricultural and pharmaceutical sources. For example, water with high levels\nof nitrate can impair oxygen transport in infants and lead exposure can impair neurodevelopment in children.\nMoreover, some of the chemicals used for disinfecting drinking water may combine with natural organic matter and\ngenerate byproducts sometimes correlated with reproductive disease and cancer such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and\nhaloacetic acids (HAAs) . Overall, due to widely varying water quality across the globe, it is important to identify which\n(if any) contaminants are of concern on the local scale.  Only then is it possible to design water treatment systems\nwhich address the necessary contaminants without adding undue complexity and wastewater.\nIn addition to providing hydration for building users, water plays a large role in other aspects of building design and\noperation. It is frequently used in heating and cooling systems, irrigation, pools and baths and general appliances.\nThese instances are associated with various concerns for contamination, such as the need to control Legionella in\ncooling systems and hot tubs.\n Additionally, if water from any source wets building materials that are not intended to\ncome into contact with water, it sets up prime conditions for mold growth.  Careful building design that integrates\nresponsive operations and allows for easy and meaningful means of inspection can mitigate the risks from water in\nthese other aspects of buildings.\nUniversal access to good water, sanitation and hygiene are often grouped in public health approaches  yet are\ninterdependent of each other. Provision of well-designed and equipped bathrooms for all, supporting appropriate\nhand washing, should reduce risks of acquiring enteric and respiratory diseases associated with poor hygiene\npractices.\n \nThe WELL Water concept aims to increase the rate of adequate hydration in building users, reduce health risks due to\ncontaminated water and excessive moisture within buildings and provide adequate sanitation through better\ninfrastructure design and operations coupled with awareness and maintenance of water quality.\nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Water Concept.

Two parameters—total coliforms and turbidity— are commonly used to\nassess the effectiveness of these systems as easy-to-test measurements for the possible presence of other, more concerning contaminants, and are therefore known as ‘indicators’.\nColiform bacteria are naturally present in the environment and are generally considered harmless. However, some coliforms are associated with fecal contamination and may cause\ndisease if ingested.  Turbidity is a measure of water cloudiness, which per-se does not constitute a health concern, however, it does relate to the availability of food and shelter for\nmicrobes, the presence of particulate contaminants and issues with the water treatment process,  along with posing an aesthetic concern. High turbidity water also can reduce the\nefficacy of water treatment technologies.   \nSolutions : Water filtration can reduce turbidity and, depending on the type of device, may also trap bacteria and other contaminants. If the water has low turbidity, disinfection at the\npoint of use with ultraviolet (UV) light may be effective at killing coliforms and pathogenic microbes.\nPART 1 VERIFY WATER QUALITY INDICATORS\nFor All Spaces:\nWater delivered to the project and intended for human contact (e.g., drinking, cooking and dishwashing,\nhandwashing, showering or bathing) meets the following thresholds:\na.

For example, natural deposits have caused arsenic to leach into some groundwaters to reach levels above drinking water\nhealth guidelines.  Water streams can also pick up contaminants from agricultural runoffs and direct industrial discharges,  whereas drinking water may encounter many opportunities to\npick up contaminants in its travel from a treatment plant to the point of use, including corrosion byproducts such as lead and copper.  Disinfectants used to prevent microbial growth\nand render water potable, such as chlorine, may react with natural organic matter and yield unwanted disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic\nacids (HAAs), to which chronic exposure needs to be minimized.\nSolutions : Drinking water is treated and distributed to meet applicable legal requirements and regulations that may differ by country,  and many building-scale interventions can\nimprove water quality depending on the contaminants that need to be removed. Typical technologies able to capture contaminants include activated carbon filters, ion exchange resins\nand reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Evaluating chemical parameters such as pH and free chlorine may inform of the potential for the uptake of corrosion byproducts and/or bacterial\ngrowth in drinking water.    \nPART 1 MEET CHEMICAL THRESHOLDS\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

Legionnaire’s disease affects especially the immunocompromised, smokers and those over age 50.  Assets commonly vulnerable to Legionella infestation include\ndomestic potable and hot water systems, cooling towers, humidifiers, misters, decorative fountains, spas and hot tubs.   \nSolutions : Basic management for water quality ensures that the water sourcing, treatment and delivery operates as designed. Turbidity, residual chlorine and pH monitoring help control\nbasic chemical and microbiological water characteristics and, if trends are detected, may inform that actions may be needed to protect the quality of the water, such as changing a filter,\ncheck the building’s pipes for leaks or inquire with the city for major works in the area. Management for minimizing Legionella requires a thorough and quantitative risk assessment of\nbuildings’ water assets, identifying locations where control is required, and a well-documented maintenance and operations program.  Implementing a proper Legionella management\nplan should reduce the risk of exposure to pathogenic bacteria.\nPART 1 MONITOR CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WATER QUALITY\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\n1: Drinking water quality report\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The following water parameters are sampled at drinking water dispensers in occupiable spaces at intervals of no\nless than once per year:\n1. Turbidity.\n2. pH.\n3. Residual (free) chlorine.\n4. Total coliforms, only if residual chlorine is below detection limits\nb. Tests are required at 5% of drinking water dispensers, up to a maximum of four tests.\nc. The water quality results are submitted annually through the WELL digital platform.\nNote :\nOn-going testing does not need to be performed by a WELL Performance Testing Agent.\nPART 2 IMPLEMENT LEGIONELLA MANAGEMENT PLAN\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Legionella plan development\nThe project provides a Legionella management plan that meets the following requirements:\na. Addresses hot water systems, cooling towers, decorative fountains and any other devices or spaces under control\nof the project where water is recirculated and aerosolized. \nb. Includes the items listed below:\n1. Determination of roles for Legionella management in the building, distinguishing those under project control\nfrom those that may be the responsibility of building management or other parties. \n2. Water system inventory and process flow diagrams of systems within the project boundary. \n3. Hazard analysis of water assets within the project boundary. If the project does not operate the building hot\nwater supply system (e.g., boilers, heaters, pumps or hot water risers), then an explanation of the building-wide\nLegionella management policies (if any) and how they influence risk is included. \n4. A list of monitoring actions for relevant variables (e.g., temperature or residual chlorine), performance limits\nassociated with these variables, and corrective actions when variables exceed such limits.\n5. A list of critical control points (locations where actions to maintain relevant variables listed in (4) within\nperformance limits are applied) within the project boundary. \n6. Verification and validation procedures for evaluating the suitability and proper implementation of the\nmanagement plan. A Legionella sampling schedule is included if projects have operational control over cooling\ntowers and spas.\n7. Protocols for documenting results of monitoring activities and corrective actions. If sampling for Legionella is\nplanned, results are included.  \n2: Legionella plan implementation\nThe following requirement is met:\na. Project submits annually through the WELL digital platform documentation of monitoring results, corrective\nactions and Legionella sample results (if any) as stated in the Legionella management plan.\nREFERENCES\n1.

While steady delivery of potable water is a reality in many places, other places must regularly contend with water that is delivered below potability standards or with\nfluctuating quality due to the intrusion of contaminants in the water distribution pipes,  unsupervised changes in municipal water supply and treatment  or weather-related events. \nSolutions : From a building perspective, sound water quality management begins with an understanding of the incoming water quality, preferably through testing and analysis of\nhistorical data. If needed, treatment devices, such as filters or UV disinfection units, can be used to achieve data-driven, health-based water quality targets.  Periodic water monitoring\nnot only confirms the quality of the water, but also helps to determine the needs for maintenance in pipes, fixtures or treatment devices. Availability of water quality results and\nmaintenance records to occupants may also increase drinking water consumption, furthering both cost-saving and sustainability efforts for the project, while also promoting occupant\nhydration.  \nPART 1 ASSESS AND MAINTAIN DRINKING WATER QUALITY (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Water quality pre-test\nFor first-time registered projects, the following requirements are met:\na.

For projects of 12 or more floors, one additional drinking water dispenser for every 10 floors. \nc. Samples must be taken with point-of-use filters or other water treatment devices bypassed or removed, if present.\nNote : Projects pursuing re-certification do not need to achieve Option 1.\n2: Water quality monitoring\nThe following requirements are met:\na. Piped water is delivered to drinking water dispensers.\nb. Water is tested quarterly in drinking water dispensers and meets the following thresholds. If any sample exceeds\nthese thresholds, remediation and re-testing occur within a month:\n1. Turbidity is 1.0 NTU, FTU or FNU or less.\n2. pH is between 6.5 and 9.0 (between 5.5 and 9 if a reverse osmosis system is installed at the point of use).\n3.

While plastic bottled water allows for portable hydration, excess\nwaste produced by the dumping and degradation of single-use bottles and the generation of microplastics is a serious environmental concern. Pollution produced by single use plastic\nproducts is a rising public health issue that requires a comprehensive toxicological assessment in order to understand its full impact.  \nSolutions : The first step toward increasing consumption of good quality water is to make it readily available and address factors that limit access. When the addition of drinking fountains\nis combined with information sessions, consumption of plain water has been found to increase.  Finally, it is important to keep water dispensers in a state of good repair to encourage\ncontinued water consumption.  Using drinking water fixtures also allows fresh water to run through pipes, preventing losses in water quality.\nPART 1 ENSURE DRINKING WATER ACCESS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\n1: Dispenser availability\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

Water delivered by the dispensers is directly piped through the building’s water supply or is stored in containers\ndesigned for refilling. \nc. All newly installed drinking water fountains are designed for water bottle-refilling.\n2: Dispenser maintenance\nAll drinking water dispensers meet the following requirement:\na. The mouthpieces/outlets, protective guards, aerators (if present), basins and touch points are cleaned on a daily\nbasis.\nREFERENCES\n1. Malisova O, Athanasatou A, Pepa A, et al.

It is\nestimated that one fifth of asthma cases in the U.S. are caused by excess moisture and dampness in buildings.  Furthermore, moisture can damage the building itself by creating an\nenvironment hospitable to insects and other destructive pests, corroding metal components and degrading wood and porous building materials.  These problems can arise when water\nunintentionally penetrates the building envelope or leaks from indoor uses of water, or when moisture-heavy air condenses on building materials.\nSolutions : Through effective design of the building's curtain wall, water piping assemblies and ventilation systems, and by selecting appropriate materials where condensation may\noccur, projects can make conditions inhospitable to mold, microbes and pests, reducing the risk to respiratory health.\n Inspections are needed to both verify that design and operations\nproperly safeguards against mold growth, as well as inform the need for preventative maintenance.\nPART 1 DESIGN ENVELOPE FOR MOISTURE PROTECTION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe building envelope aims to minimize moisture intrusion and accumulation through the following:\na. For a project where construction occurs after enrollment or the start of subscription, verification of site drainage\nand storm water management during building construction phase.\nb. Air tightness testing to assess water vapor transfer.\nc. Adverse vapor pressure differentials that may cause condensation on interstitially hidden materials.\nd. Entryway design that considers at least three strategies to minimize the ingress or permeation of water into the\nbuilding.\ne. Installation of a continuous drainage plane (e.g., a weather-resistant barrier integrated with flashing systems at\npenetrations), interior to the exterior cladding.\nf. Minimization of capillary suction (wicking) in porous building materials through one of the below capillary break\nmethods:\n1. Free-draining spaces (e.g., between exterior cladding, weather-resistant barriers in wall assemblies).\n2. Non-porous materials (e.g., closed-cell foams, waterproofing membranes, metal) between porous materials.\nPART 2 DESIGN INTERIORS FOR MOISTURE MANAGEMENT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Condensation and liquid water management\nThe project implements measures to manage moisture in interior spaces that address, at a minimum, the following:\na. Protection of moisture-sensitive building materials and selection of moisture-resistant materials or finishes in\nsurfaces likely to be exposed to liquid water (e.g., finished floors) or that may absorb moisture such as interior\nsheathing in basements, areas at or below grade, bathrooms, janitorial rooms or kitchens.\nb. Condensation on cold surfaces such as basements, slab-on-grade floors, the inside of exterior walls and glazing.\n2: Water leak control in fixtures\nThe following requirements are met:\na. All hard-piped fixtures, such as toilets, dishwashers, icemakers, water treatment devices and clothes washers, have\na labeled, readily accessible single-throw manual shut-off or automatic shut-off at point-of-connection.\nb. For water treatment devices that have a waste or drain line (e.g., reverse osmosis systems and water softeners), the\ndrain or waste line is plumbed in-place and is equipped with a backflow prevention system such as an air gap or a\nbackflow preventer valve.\nPART 3 IMPLEMENT MOLD AND MOISTURE MANAGEMENT PLAN (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Operational moisture management\nThe project implements a moisture management plan for building operations that contains the following:\na. A schedule of periodic inspections for signs and potential sources of water damage or pooling, discoloration and\nmold on ceilings, walls, floors and HVAC equipment.\nb. A system or inspection protocol to periodically assess water pipe leaks.\nc.

Proper hand hygiene is key to reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases after bathroom use.\nSomething as seemingly simple as using the bathroom can be challenging for some.\n  For example, women often lack necessary bathroom accommodations due to a lack of sufficient\nsanitary materials.\n Caregivers, small children, older adults or other individuals who require assistance frequently lack access to spaces that support their needs.    Despite hand\nwashing, hands can only become as clean as the surrounding environment. Sinks may harbor pathogenic bacteria that can migrate onto hands during washing.  Water splashing from the\ndrain may spread bacteria to surrounding areas.\n Additionally, soap and the inside of liquid soap containers often remain contaminated after use; thus, best practice and research\nrecommends that soap dispensers not be topped off.\n Lastly, once an individual's hands are cleaned, they can more easily become re-infected when wet compared to when dry.\nSolutions : Bathrooms can be designed and furnished to ease hygiene, particularly for menstruating women (e.g., by supplying female hygiene products)\n and for supporting caregivers\nof children  and individuals with physical and mental disabilities.  Trash receptacles, baby changing stations, large sinks, fragrance-free soap, hand dryers and fixtures that minimize\nunnecessary contact with the hands can be provided. Single-user facilities with gender neutral signage make bathrooms available for all individuals.  Visual cues that promote hand\nhygiene may improve compliance with established guidelines in certain segments of the population.\n \nPART 1 PROVIDE EQUIPPED BATHROOMS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\n1: Furnishings for all bathrooms\nThe project meets the following requirements:\na. All bathrooms include:\n1. Trash receptacles in stalls (in women’s and single-user bathrooms). If toilet paper cannot be flushed down\ntoilets, trash receptacles must be placed in all bathroom stalls such that they do not impede\nwheelchair/mobility aid access.\n2. Sanitary pads, tampons and/or other menstrual products at no cost or subsidized by at least 50% (in women’s\nand single-user bathrooms).\n3. A hook, shelf or equivalent storage support in each toilet stall. For wheelchair accessible stalls, storage support\nitems are placed no higher than {{well-unit}}122 cm|48 in{{/well-unit}}.\nb. All occupants have access to at least one bathroom per occupiable floor that provides a stall that can\naccommodate a wheelchair user and care attendant. \nc. All occupants have access to at least one bathroom that provides an infant changing table.\nd. All regular occupants may confidentially request a syringe drop box, which is made available at no cost in one or\nmore bathrooms.\ne. All single-user bathrooms (if present) are open to all individuals with accompanying signage.\nf. If present, floor drains are equipped with a self-primed liquid-seal trap or a waterless trap seal.\n2: Furnishings for family bathrooms\nFor projects where the majority of occupants are visitors (e.g., shopping malls, airports, museums), family bathrooms\nare provided to meet expected demand by individuals in need of accompaniment or assistance in the bathroom (e.g.,\nchildren, individuals with mental or physical disabilities) and contain the following amenities:\na. Changing table for infants.\nb. Children’s toilet facilities or accommodations for child use of adult-size toilet.\nc. Children’s sinks or accommodations for child use of adult-size sink (e.g., availability of stepstool).\nd. Motion sensor lights.\ne. Slip-resistant floors.\nf. Grab bars.\ng.

{"feature": "W09", "page_start": 56, "page_end": 58, "content": "W09 Β ONSITE NON-POTABLE WATER REUSE | O (MAX : 2 PT )\nIntent : Conserve water through non-potable water systems without compromising the health of the building occupants.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects to implement a safety plan when capturing and using non-potable water within the project boundary.\nIssue : Efficient water management is an ever-growing need for supporting and sustaining human existence.  The rise of extreme droughts and subsequent long-term water scarcity are\nrequiring changes in how humans think about and use water.  Conversely, severe rain events can overload wastewater treatment plants with storm- and rainwater, potentially resulting in\ncombined sewer overflows (CSOs), in which untreated water is released to natural bodies of water and beaches downstream.  Buildings can reduce the pressure on city-wide water\ninfrastructure by supporting efficient allocation of resources, such as minimizing the use of municipally sourced water for applications that do not require potability (e.g., irrigation,\nflushing toilets).  However, without proper design and operations management, there is a risk of contamination of potable water lines or oral or respiratory exposure to non-potable\nwater.\nSolutions : The design and operations of a healthy, non-potable water system must address the water sources and uses. For instance, water coming from clothes washers and showers,\nas well as stormwater collected at the street level, requires treatment and water quality monitoring before reuse. The system should be designed so that water capture and reuse does\nnot create niches of water stagnation, and storage tanks for non-potable water need periodic checks and safeguards against overflows.  Additionally, pipes destined to distribute non-\npotable water must not be commingled with those for drinking water, and proper control measures must be in place if potable water supplements non-potable water applications (e.g.,\ntoilet flushing).  Finally, smells and odors need to be managed to avoid the perception of a health threat, as this may hinder efforts to improve water management and conservation in a\nbuilding.\n While there are many factors to consider, these challenges can be managed through a properly implemented safety plan that addresses health endpoints in the collection,\ntreatment and distribution of non-potable water within the building.  The success in the implementation of this plan also depends on third party verification, in which the plan is\nevaluated with respect to the achievement of its health endpoints.\n  Additionally, education and signage are essential in supporting occupants' understanding of the positive impact of\nsensible water utilization within buildings and of the measures taken to protect human health.  By properly managing and controlling non-potable water reuse and capture systems,\nprojects can help maintain occupant health and safety, while contributing to decreased water use by up to 75% in new buildings.\nPART 1 IMPLEMENT SAFETY PLAN FOR NON-POTABLE WATER CAPTURE AND REUSE (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Safety plan description\nThe project or organization implements a safety plan that contains the following:\na. A list of key roles for design, operations, maintenance and third-party inspection of the non-potable water system\ncapture, treatment and use.  \nb.

A process flow diagram that displays the non-potable water sources, conveyances, storage units, treatment\ndevices and points of use, emphasizing the points where makeup potable water (i.e., water needed to supplement\nnon-potable needs) may be added.\nd. A description of the system that includes the sources and estimated contaminant loads of the non-potable water,\nthe intended uses for the non-potable water, the water treatment devices (if any) and their certifications, and the\nwater quality parameters expected at the points of use.  \ne. An analysis of how human exposure to pathogens through ingestion and inhalation of non-potable water is\nminimized, including (if applicable) a description of how the potable water network is protected from the\nintroduction of non-potable water, emphasizing strategies that address cross-connection control and backflow\nprevention.  \nf. A description of the signage and identifiable pipe color-coding to distinguish the non-potable water network.\ng. A list of strategies for the control of odors, nuisances and vectors due to stagnation of non-potable water.\nh. The provisions for emergency operations caused by overflow of storage tanks, leaks and outages.  \ni. A list of operational parameters (such as flow, turbidity, coliforms or other treatment-dependent indicators) to\nmonitor the intended functioning of the water system, their monitoring frequency and control actions if such\nparameters are beyond target ranges.\nj. A list of control points where the operational parameters are being measured.  \nk. A list of routine maintenance protocols and schedules.\nl.

It\nencourages the creation of food environments, where the healthiest choice is the easiest choice.\nHealthy diets have the potential to nurture human health and prevent several diet-related diseases, including\ncardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. However, poor nutrition remains a top contributor to the\nglobal burden of disease, accounting for more than one in every five deaths globally.  In fact, unhealthy diets pose a\ngreater risk to morbidity and mortality than drug, alcohol and tobacco use combined.  The global population is\ncurrently facing a double burden of disease, in which much of the population is malnourished and suffering from\nmicronutrient deficiencies, as well as an increasing prevalence of overweight, obesity and non-communicable\ndiseases. Diets around the world are generally low in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds,  and are\ncharacterized by increasing intakes of highly processed foods, including refined sugars and refined oils, as well as the\ngrowing consumption of meat.  Fortunately, individual dietary choices have the potential to shift global dietary\npatterns toward healthier diets, providing major health benefits and preventing diet-related diseases.\nDiets inextricably link human health and environmental health and sustainability. The current global transition towards\nunhealthy and unsustainably produced food is threatening global food systems as food production remains one the\nlargest contributors to global environmental change.  In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission developed, for the first\ntime, global scientific targets for a healthy reference diet based on the best available evidence for healthy diets and\nsustainable food production.  This healthy reference diet can be adapted to all food cultures and is characterized by a\nvariety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and small amounts of animal source foods, highly\nprocessed foods, refined grains and added sugars.  Given the strong connection between food production and food\navailability and consumption, global achievement of healthy diets from sustainable food systems requires a global\nfood transformation.\nOur dietary patterns are influenced by a complex mixture of personal, cultural and environmental factors, including\nthe buildings and communities where we spend the majority of our time and consume the majority of our meals. The\nway our food environments are designed and operated, as well as the availability and access to foods and beverages\nin these environments, has the potential to support healthy diets and improve human health with the health of the\nplanet in mind. In fact, research shows that individual change is more likely to occur when environmental conditions\nand influences are aligned to support individual behaviors.\n Therefore, improving diet quality and eating behaviors\nrequires a holistic approach, which includes both supportive policies and environmental change.\n \nThe WELL Nourishment concept supports healthy and sustainable eating patterns by increasing access to fruits and\nvegetables, limiting the availability of highly processed foods and designing environments that nudge individuals\ntoward healthier choices.\n \nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Nourishment Concept. Note: Material from the research digests is not covered on the WELL AP exam.\nREFERENCES\n1. Afshin A, Sur PJ, Fay KA, et al.

However, most individuals around the world do not meet the daily\nrecommended five servings (400 g).  Insufficient fruit and vegetable intake is attributed to 5.2 million deaths worldwide in 2013, as well as 14% of gastrointestinal cancer deaths, 11% of\nischemic heart disease deaths and 9% of stroke deaths globally.  Greater consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2\ndiabetes, stroke and certain types of cancers, as well as improved weight management.\n Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables also helps to ensure adequate nutrient, micronutrient\nand dietary fiber intake.    \nSolutions : Increasing the availability and access of fruits and vegetables can support fruit and vegetable consumption. Increased availability of fresh fruit at worksites has been shown to\nimprove fruit and vegetable consumption at work and at home, indicating that individuals take these healthier habits home.  Strategies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption\ninclude behavioral interventions, such as increased availability and visibility of fruits and vegetables, pricing incentives to lower the cost of fruits and vegetables and promotion and\nsupport of community gardens and urban agriculture initiatives.  \nPART 1 PROVIDE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\nFor All Spaces except Commercial Dining Spaces:\nOption 1: Food offerings\nEach food outlet meets one of the following requirements:\na. The selection includes at least two different individually selectable fruit offerings (containing no added sugar) and\nat least two different individually selectable non-fried vegetable offerings.\nb. At least 50% of available food options are individually selectable fruit offerings (containing no added sugar) and/or\nindividually selectable non-fried vegetable offerings.\nOption 2: No food offerings\nThe following requirement is met: \na. There are no foods sold or provided on a daily basis by (or under contract with) the project owner.\nFor Commercial Dining Spaces:\nOne of the following requirements is met:\na. The selection includes at least four different individually selectable fruit offerings (containing no added sugar) and\nat least four different individually selectable non-fried vegetable offerings.\nb. At least 50% of available food options are individually selectable fruit offerings (containing no added sugar) and/or\nindividually selectable non-fried vegetable offerings.\nPART 2 PROMOTE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE VISIBILITY\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Food offerings\nFruit and vegetable offerings sold or provided on a daily basis by (or under contract with) the project owner meet the\nfollowing requirements:\na.   Fruit and vegetable offerings that are self-serve meet at least one of the following: i. Are located at eye-level or\njust below eye-level.\n ii. Are displayed on a countertop, table or other visible surface.  iii. Are located at point-\nof-sale or point-of-purchase.\n iv. Are located at the end of aisles.\n v. Are located at the beginning of food\nservice lines.\n vi. Are visible from the food outlet entrance.\n \nb.   If food is prepared on-site and presented on menus (including digital menus and menu boards), fruit and\nvegetable offerings meet at least three of the following: i. Are included as default options throughout the menu.\nii. Are listed using appealing descriptions.\n iii. Are visually highlighted through icons, different colors or\nbolding.  iv. Are listed first in each menu section.  v. Are listed in prominent areas of the menu (e.g., the top,\nbottom, corners).\nOption 2: No food offerings\nThe following requirement is met:\na.

These provide consumers with useful nutrient, ingredient and food\nallergen information that can be used to guide food choices and daily intake. However, the same level of nutritional transparency does not exist for foods and beverages in restaurants,\nvending machines and a variety of food retail establishments. Nutritional transparency is especially important for the millions of individuals with food allergies and food intolerances, who\nmust navigate many issues when dining away from home. Moreover, evidence suggests that health warnings can help increase health knowledge and the purchase and consumption of\ncertain products.   \nSolutions : Although evidence is inconsistent as to whether calorie labeling reduces calories purchased or calories consumed, the increased transparency has led to the introduction of\nlower-calorie items in restaurants and other food establishments.\n Research also suggests that calorie labeling and similar health labeling interventions may serve as important sources\nof nutritional information for consumers, resulting in healthier food choices and increased calorie information awareness.\n Since there is no cure for food allergies, avoidance of food\nallergens is a recommended strategy for preventing serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. Food service professionals play a critical role in helping consumers navigate food\nchoices and making all spaces safer for individuals with food allergies and intolerances. Food allergy training helps ensure that all food service staff are properly trained to address\npotential food allergens and intolerances.   \nPART 1 PROVIDE NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Food offerings\n  For packaged foods and beverages (including items in vending machines) and self-serve bulk foods, sold or provided\non a daily basis by (or under contract with) the project owner, the following nutrition information is clearly displayed\nat point-of-decision on packaging or adjacent signage:    \na. Total calories per serving or package.\nb. Macronutrient content (total protein, total fat and total carbohydrate) in weight and/or as a percent of the\nestimated daily requirements (daily values) per serving or package.\nc. Total sugar content per serving or package.\nOption 2: No packaged food offerings\nThe following requirement is met:\na. There are no packaged foods and beverages sold or provided on a daily basis by (or under contract with) the\nproject owner.\nFor Commercial Dining Spaces:\nFor standard menu items sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner, the following requirements\nare met:\na. The number of calories contained in each standard menu item, as usually prepared and offered for sale, is clearly\ndisplayed at the point-of-decision. \nb. The macronutrient content (total protein, total fat and total carbohydrate) and total sugar content of each\nstandard menu item is available upon request.\nPART 2 ADDRESS FOOD ALLERGENS\nFor Commercial Kitchen Spaces:\nFood is prepared on-site by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and the following\nrequirements are met:\na. All food service staff (including managers, servers and kitchen staff) are offered annual food allergy training that\ncovers, at a minimum, the following topics:\n1. Overview of food allergies.\n2. Anaphylaxis response protocols.\n3. Emergency response protocols.\n4. Communications protocols.\n5. Reducing risk for cross-contact.\n6. Use of recipes and ingredient disclosure.\n7. Knowledge test.\nb. At least one food service staff member who has completed the food allergy training within 12 months is present to\nhandle questions and special requests from individuals about food allergens during hours of operation.\nFor Commercial Dining Spaces:\nFood is prepared on-site by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and the following requirement\nis met:\n1\n2–4\n5–7\nOR\n8\nPage 61 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\na. Point-of-decision signage is present to encourage individuals to report their food allergies to food service staff.\nPART 3 LABEL SUGAR CONTENT\nFor Commercial Dining Spaces:\nOption 1: No high sugar foods\nFor standard menu items sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner, the following requirement is\nmet:\na. Standard menu items do not contain more than 25 g of sugar per serving.\nOption 2: Label high sugar foods\nFor standard menu items sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner, one of the following\nrequirements is met:\na. The total sugar content for each standard menu item, as usually prepared and offered for sale, is clearly displayed\nat the point-of-decision (in addition to calories as required in Part 1 of this feature).\nb. Standard menu items containing more than 25 g of sugar per serving are identified by an icon at the point-of-\ndecision, along with an explanation of the icon and the health risks of high sugar intake.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Sugar consumption, especially added sugar, has been associated with poor diet\nquality, an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and tooth decay.\n Refining grains removes most of their vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Dietary fiber has been linked to a lower\nrisk of heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes and obesity and is associated with improved digestive health.    \nSolutions : Increasing access to healthier food items includes increasing the availability of healthier alternatives, as well as limiting the availability of highly processed foods. Based on\nrecommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), on average, adults should consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar per day.  Limiting intake of sugar-sweetened\nbeverages and sugary foods can help individuals meet the WHO sugar recommendations and reduce their daily sugar intake. Promoting the consumption of whole grains by increasing\nwhole grain options can also help individuals increase their intake of dietary fiber.\nPART 1 LIMIT TOTAL SUGARS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFoods and beverages are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and meet the\nfollowing requirements:\na. Beverages do not contain more than 25 g of sugar per container or serving.\nb. At least 25% of beverages contain no sugar per container or serving, or drinking water is available at no cost.\nc. Non-beverage food items (except whole fruit) do not contain more than 25 g of sugar per serving.\nPART 2 PROMOTE WHOLE GRAINS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nGrain-based foods are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and meet the\nfollowing requirements:\na. In at least 50% of grain-based foods (foods that have a grain flour as the first ingredient or that contain ≥30% grain\ningredients), a whole grain is the first ingredient.\nb. If both whole-grain and refined-grain options are available, whole-grain options do not cost more than their\nrefined-grain counterparts (e.g., brown rice does not cost more than white rice).\nNote : Projects must have at least one whole grain option at each food outlet (if grain-based foods are sold or provided) but the 50% calculation may be considered across the entire food\nservice operation (per food category or total number of grain-based foods).\nREFERENCES\n1.

Food advertising and marketing is ubiquitous and takes several forms, including direct and indirect advertising, product sale contracts and\nsponsored materials. Children and youth are particularly susceptible to food advertising.  Research has found a strong association between advertising for non-nutritious foods and\nchildren’s behavioral and mental health.  Exposure to unhealthy food advertising increases food consumption in children but not adults.  Moreover, the marketing and advertising of\nhigh-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages increases children’s preference and intake of unhealthy foods and beverages.  In adults, exposure to food advertising is shown to\ninfluence food choices and eating behaviors.\nSolutions : Healthy food advertising has been shown to increase the selection of healthier items and may have a stronger impact than anti-obesity advertising on shaping eating\nbehaviors.  These interventions have been effective in a variety of food settings including, cafeterias, corner stores, grocery stores and supermarkets.\n  \nPART 1 OPTIMIZE FOOD ADVERTISING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Food advertising\nIf foods and beverages are sold or provided on a daily basis by (or under contract with) the project owner, the\nfollowing requirements are met:\na.   Sugar-sweetened beverages are not advertised or promoted.\nb.   Deep-fried food options are not advertised or promoted.\nc. Deep-fried food options are not displayed under heat lamps. \n2: Nutritional messaging\nAll dedicated eating spaces and points of sale contain at least two different instances of messaging that promote one\nof the following:\na. The consumption of fruits and vegetables.    \nb.   The consumption of drinking water.\nREFERENCES\n1. Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity.

However, since these additives do not add nutritional value to\na food and tend to appear in foods with low nutritional quality, they should be avoided as often as possible. While some artificial ingredients do not carry immediate health risks, they may\nbecome toxic when consumed in large quantities and many have not been evaluated for their effects on metabolic regulation or potential contributions to obesity.   Certain artificial\ndyes that are approved for use in the U.S. may also be carcinogenic, cause hypersensitivity reactions and behavioral problems or be inadequately tested.  In the EU, for example, foods\nthat contain artificial dyes are required to carry label warnings that they may cause hyperactivity in children.\n   \nSolutions : Sourcing packaged foods and beverages without artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners and preservatives can help limit artificial ingredient consumption, as well as promote a\ndiet of whole, natural foods. Labeling and phasing out the use of artificial ingredients that have been deemed ingredients of concern is another way to help individuals avoid\nconsumption of additives. Fortunately, many food companies are phasing out artificial ingredients or reformulating recipes to remove them, a trend partly driven by growing consumer\ndemand and an increased desire for nutritional transparency.\nPART 1 LIMIT ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Artificial ingredient phase out\nFoods and beverages are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and meet the\nfollowing requirements:\na.

Larger packaging, meal sizes and\ndishware sizes are possible contributors to growing portion sizes, especially when portion and serving sizes do not align.   \nSolutions : Smaller portion size options for meals and individual food items can encourage reasonable portions without infringing on individual choice.\n Reducing the portion size of\nfoods and beverages that are not nutrient dense, such as processed foods, can help individuals maintain calorie balance and reduce added sugar consumption.  Dishware sizes can also\nbe adjusted to promote healthier portion sizes. Larger dishware is associated with larger self-served portions and greater energy intake in both adults and children.\n Individuals also\ntend to underestimate the quantity of food when it is presented on a larger plate and overestimate the quantity when it is presented on a smaller plate.\n Though the effect of plate size\nmay vary based on an individual's body weight or gender, it may have more influence when purposely used to guide appropriate portions.\nPART 1 PROMOTE HEALTHY PORTIONS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor Commercial Dining Spaces:\nFoods and beverages are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and meet the\nfollowing requirements:\na.

Studies report a positive relationship between food literacy levels and healthy dietary intake. Unfortunately, due to a global dietary shift away from whole\ningredient foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and towards highly processed foods that require little-to-no skill in preparation and cooking, many people lack adequate food literacy to\nmake healthy choices.  Therefore, nutrition and food education programs focused on increasing levels of food literacy are important to individual health and well-being. Participation in\nfood and nutrition education programs have been associated with increased fruit and vegetable intake, knowledge of food preparation skills, and improvements in healthy behaviors.\nSolutions : Nutrition education has been shown to be more effective when focused on changing specific behaviors, rather than only increasing knowledge.\n Nutrition education is also\nmore effective when combined with environmental dietary modifications, such as strategic placement of healthier alternatives, portion size control and menu modifications. Educational\nprogramming that includes multiple types of interventions (mixed-method programming) and that is on-going or longer term has a greater impact than short-term, single-method\ninterventions.\n The scope of nutrition and food education may also be broader than personal nutrition and health. For example, education can cover topics, such as safe food handling\npractices, gardening and food production techniques, as well as food preparation skills.\nPART 1 PROVIDE NUTRITION EDUCATION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least one of the following is offered live (in-person or virtually) to regular occupants at no cost on a quarterly basis\nat minimum:\na. Cooking demonstrations led by chef-instructors that include fruits and/or vegetables, demonstrate cooking skills\nand integrate hands-on learning opportunities.\nb. Nutrition or dietary education sessions led by an accredited dietitian or accredited nutritionist.\nc. Individual nutrition consultations led by an accredited dietitian or accredited nutritionist.\nd. Gardening or planting workshops focused on edible plants that integrate hands-on learning opportunities. \nREFERENCES\n1. Vaitkeviciute R, Ball LE, Harris N.

Additional factors - economic, social, psychological and environmental also shape our\nfood choice. Recently, eating alone and distracted eating have become emerging social concerns and are associated with a variety of social and health outcomes. Studies have found\nthat people who tend to eat alone may be more likely to choose unhealthier foods, eat fewer fruits and vegetables and eat at irregular times. Eating alone may also be a potential risk\nfactor for metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n There is also some evidence to indicate that distracted eating while\nworking, reading, watching television or listening to music is associated with higher food intake both immediately and later on.     \nSolutions : Eating attentively and placing focus on the process of eating may lead to better control of one’s food intake. A positive relationship also exists between mindful eating and\nmental well-being.  The provision of dedicated eating spaces can encourage individuals to enjoy meals together, prevent distracted eating at workstations and lead to better eating\nhabits. In addition to eating spaces, having designated meal periods can help ensure individuals have and take time to eat meals mindfully.    \nPART 1 SUPPORT MINDFUL EATING (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\n1: Dedicated eating space\nA dedicated eating space is located within a {{well-unit}}650 ft|200 m{{/well-unit}} walk distance of the project\nboundary and meets the following requirements:\na.

The World Allergy\nOrganization reports that the prevalence of food allergies is increasing in countries around the world.  A growing number of individuals are also omitting certain ingredients or following\nspecial diets for a variety of personal, health, social and environmental reasons.  Such dietary exclusion or restriction may have nutritional consequences and lead to a nutritionally\ndeficient diet.\n Dietary guidelines increasingly recognize a variety of healthy eating patterns, such as the Mediterranean-style and vegetarian eating patterns, that can help ensure an\nindividual’s diet is both nutritionally adequate and enjoyable.    \nSolutions : Meal alternatives for common food allergies or intolerances and dietary restrictions can help support individual dietary preferences and ensure the availability of meal options\nand balanced meals for everyone. Alternatives can minimize the stress and worry associated with food and dietary restrictions. Suitable meal options can also minimize the risk of\nindividuals consuming potentially harmful foods. To further support individuals with special dietary needs, alternative food items can be offered at the same or similar price as standard\nitems. Ingredient transparency through accurate food allergen labeling can help individuals identify and avoid potential allergens.   \nPART 1 ACCOMMODATE SPECIAL DIETS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nMeals with main dishes are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and include\nat least one option that meets the following requirements:\na.

This is a concerning trend, since meals consumed away from home are often higher in calories,\nlower in nutrients and larger in portion size.  Emerging research has found an association between eating away from home and a higher BMI and lower fruit and vegetable consumption\nin adults.  Analysis of dietary intake data also shows that individuals who bring food from home tend to have a better diet quality than individuals who purchase food away from\nhome.  In addition to nutritional benefits, preparing meals at home has financial benefits. Frequent home cooking is linked to reduced food expenditures, whereas frequently eating away\nfrom home is associated with higher food expenditures.\nSolutions : Spaces that allow individuals to reheat or assemble food prepared at home can support healthy eating habits and cooking skills. Sufficient cold storage space can help ensure\nsafe food storage for individuals who bring meals from home. Other supportive amenities, such as eating utensils and devices for reheating food can make it even easier for individuals to\nconsume homemade meals and encourage healthy eating patterns.  \nPART 1 PROVIDE MEAL SUPPORT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units, Commercial Kitchen Spaces & Guest Rooms:\nThe following supportive amenities are provided in a quantity that meets employee demand in at least one dedicated\neating area within a {{well-unit}}650 ft|200 m{{/well-unit}} walk distance of the project boundary:\na.

Studies have confirmed\nthat the use of antibiotics in agriculture and animals contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance in humans, and dietary pesticide exposure has been associated with adverse\nreproductive consequences in women and men.\n The consumption of certain pesticides has also been linked to an increased risk for some types of cancer, and pregnant women\nexposed to higher amounts of pesticides have given birth to children with lower IQ.\n   \nSolutions : Responsible sourcing practices and policies can help promote sustainable food purchasing, encourage humane animal treatment, and consider broader social and\nenvironmental impacts. While organically grown foods may not be significantly more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, organic produce has been shown to have lower levels\nof pesticide residue and organic chicken and pork are less likely to contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria than conventional food.  Animal welfare standards serve to ensure that animals\nare raised in humane conditions and address topics such as space allowance, transportation, feed and outdoor access provided for farm animals.  Humane practices also limit the use of\nantibiotics and hormones on animals. Labeling organic and humanely raised foods can help individuals quickly identify these products, as well as promote local farms and organizations.\nPART 1 IMPLEMENT RESPONSIBLE SOURCING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Sustainable sourcing\nFoods and beverages are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and the total\nproduct line meets the following criteria:\na. At least 50% of the total produce line (fruits and vegetables) is certified organic.\nb. At least 25% of the total animal product line (meat, seafood, egg and dairy products) is certified organic, Certified\nHumane® or certified by a GSSI-recognized Seafood Certification Scheme.\n2: Sustainable labeling\nSustainable and humane agriculture is promoted through the following, as applicable:\na.   Certified organic and sustainable products are labeled at point-of-decision.\nb.   Local farms or sources are advertised at point-of-decision for locally sourced foods.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Most food is produced or processed hundreds of miles from where it is consumed, often threatening local food systems and contributing to a sense of detachment. More recently,\nconsumers have an increasing desire to know how their food is made, raised or grown, in order to better understand the consequences of their food purchases.  This has led to the\ngrowth of a global movement committed to reconnecting individuals, communities and local food systems.\nSolutions : Increasing availability to locally grown food is important for many reasons, including strengthening food systems and contributing to healthier communities and ecosystems.\nIndividuals who participate in community and home gardening projects have higher levels of fruit and vegetable consumption and are more likely to meet national recommendations for\nfruit and vegetable intakes than nongardeners.\n Individual participation in community agriculture has also been linked to increased household fruit and vegetable intake.  Beyond\ncontributing to nutritional benefits, gardens are associated with several social benefits. Participation in community gardening can help fortify community cohesion and involvement,\nincrease physical activity, provide on-site educational opportunities and increase perceptions of community safety.\n Gardening may also benefit mental health, by reducing symptoms\nof anxiety and depression.\nPART 1 PROVIDE GARDENING SPACE (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nA permanent and accessible space for food production is located within a {{well-unit}}0.25 mi|400 m{{/well-\nunit}} walk distance of the project boundary and meets the following requirements:\na.

The local\nfood environment encompasses the type and density of food retail outlets, including grocery stores and food service outlets, and the consistent availability of healthy, wholesome foods\nat these venues. However, certain environments have the potential to be more obesogenic than others, promoting weight gain and possibly contributing to obesity.  In particular, the\npresence of smaller grocery stores and fast food establishments influence food choices and is associated with a higher prevalence of obesity.\nSolutions : Locating projects within close proximity to supermarkets, grocery stores and farmers markets can help individuals improve their dietary and lifestyle behaviors, through\nenvironments that support better food choices.\n Hospitals and healthcare institutions that host farmers’ markets and farm stands contribute to healthier nutrition environments by\npositively impacting fruit and vegetable consumption, an effective model that may be generalizable to other large institutions.\n Beyond farmers’ markets, increased healthy food retail\noutlet density is associated with a lower BMI, while supermarket availability is associated with meeting dietary recommendations.\n Mobile food markets, food carts and fruit and\nvegetable stands are additional ways to increase access to fruits and vegetables in the environments where individuals live, work and learn.   \nPART 1 ENSURE LOCAL FOOD ACCESS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Supportive environment\nThe main building entrance is located within a {{well-unit}}0.25 mi|400 m{{/well-unit}} walk distance of one of the\nfollowing:\na. Supermarket or store with a fresh fruit and vegetable section.\nb. Farmers' market that is open at least once a week and operates for at least four months of the year.\nOption 2: Supportive programming\nThe project meets one of the following requirements:\na. Serves as a distribution point for a community-based agriculture program that delivers fruits and vegetables at\nleast twice a month for at least four months of the year, in which regular occupants can participate.\nb. Hosts the weekly sale of fruits and vegetables (e.g., fruit and vegetable carts or stands, mobile markets) for at least\nfour months of the year.\nOption 3: Supportive transportation\nThe project meets the following requirement:\na. Transportation is provided at no cost between the project and a supermarket and/or store with a fresh fruit and\nvegetable section and/or farmers market.\nREFERENCES\n1. Swinburn B, Egger G, Raza F.

In 2015, the World\nHealth Organization classified processed meat as carcinogenic (cancer-causing) and red meat as probably carcinogenic.  Processed meat includes meat that has been processed through\nsalting, smoking, curing or other processes to improve flavor or preservation while red meat includes unprocessed mammalian muscle meat such as beef, veal, pork and lamb.  Although\nred meat is a source of protein and minerals and vitamins, such as iron and vitamin B12, many studies show that a high intake of red meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal\ncancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic diseases.\n Consumption of processed meat is more strongly associated with colorectal cancer and also positively associated with\nstomach cancer. Globally, food production practices that support the consumption of plant-based foods, including meat alternatives, are more likely to contribute to a sustainable food\nsystem and healthier environment for all.\nSolutions : Providing plant-based meat alternatives, reducing the portion size of red meat servings and repositioning meat products has the potential to decrease the demand for and\nconsumption of meat.  The World Cancer Research Fund recommends that individuals who consume red meat limit their intake to no more than three portions per week (equivalent to\n{{well-unit}}12–18 oz|350–500 g{{/well-unit}} per week) and to avoid eating processed meat.  Plant-based protein sources such as nuts, legumes (pulses) and cereals (grains) as well as\npoultry, fish, eggs and dairy are valuable sources of protein and nutrients and are recommended alternatives to red meat.  Smaller portions and leaner cuts of red meat are also\nencouraged for individuals who normally consume red meat.  In food service, chefs and menu developers can help shift eating patterns by positioning red meat as a supplement (side\ndish) or condiment to plant-based dishes and by limiting processed meat options.\nPART 1 LIMIT RED AND PROCESSED MEATS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor Commercial Dining Spaces:\nFoods and beverages are sold or provided by (or under contract with) the project owner on a daily basis and meet the\nfollowing requirements, as applicable:\na. At least one plant-based option is available at each food outlet.\nb. A single portion or serving of red meat, if sold or provided, is less than {{well-unit}}5.3 oz|150 g{{/well-unit}}\nuncooked weight or less than {{well-unit}}4 oz|115 g{{/well-unit}} cooked weight.\nc.

Light enters the human body through the eye, where it is\nsensed by photoreceptors in the retina that are linked to the visual and circadian systems. Humans are diurnal,\nmeaning they are innately prone to wakefulness during the day and sleepiness at night. Light exposure stimulates the\ncircadian system, which starts in the brain and regulates physiological rhythms throughout the body’s tissues and\norgans, such as hormone levels and the sleep-wake cycle.  Humans and animals have internal clocks that synchronize\nphysiological functions on a roughly 24-hour cycle called the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is synchronized\nwith the natural day-night cycle through different environmental cues, the main cue being light. Disruption or\ndesynchronization of the circadian rhythm has been linked with obesity, diabetes, depression and metabolic\ndisorders.\nExposure to bright light at night is associated with circadian phase disruption, which in turn can cause\nnegative health effects, such as breast cancer and metabolic and sleep disorders.\n  High lighting levels at night,\nincluding light from bright screens, can contribute to the disruption of the circadian rhythm.\n \nAll light—not just sunlight—can contribute to circadian photoentrainment.  Given that people spend much of their\nwaking day indoors, insufficient illumination or improper lighting design can lead to drifting of the circadian phase,\nespecially if paired with inappropriate light exposure at night.\n Humans are continuously sensitive to light, and under\nnormal circumstances, light exposure in the late night/early morning will shift our rhythms forward (phase advance),\nwhereas exposure in the late afternoon/early night will shift our rhythms back (phase delay).  Phase delays and phase\nadvances in the circadian rhythm can impact sleep-wake cycles and desynchronize circadian rhythms. To maintain\noptimal, properly synchronized circadian rhythms, the body requires periods of both light and darkness.\nStudies have shown that light exposure has an impact on the mood and reduces symptoms of depression in\nindividuals.\n Exposure to light has also been directly linked with health and can affect how we recover and heal.\nRooms with large, sun-facing windows have been shown to reduce recovery time for patients suffering from severe\ndepression and those recuperating after heart attacks, compared to similarly afflicted patients in rooms with windows\nfacing buildings or other obstructions.  Reduced exposure to daylight has been linked to the onset of depression and\nimpairment of cognitive function in individuals.\n Studies show strong links between better views, brighter light and\nbetter performance in office environments.\nThe lighting environments where humans spend their time impact their visual, circadian and mental health. Currently,\nlighting conditions in most spaces are designed to meet the visual needs of individuals but do not take into account\ncircadian and mental health. This presents an opportunity for projects to provide lighting conditions required by\nhumans for improved health and well-being.\nIntegrating daylight and electric light to create lighting strategies focused on human health, along with traditional\nrequirements for visual acuity and comfort, can lead to healthier and more productive environments. Understanding\nthe specific needs and preferences of users in a space is integral to creating effective lighting environments. For\nexample, patients in a hospital ward have different lighting requirements than individuals in an office environment.\nUnderstanding user needs in a space is key to creating a healthier space. Environments that take into account these\nlighting strategies and user needs can contribute to improvement of the overall mood and increase the productivity of\nemployees.\nThe WELL Light concept aims to provide a lighting environment that reduces circadian phase disruption, improves\nsleep quality and positively impacts mood and productivity.\nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Light Concept.

Light is the main driver of the circadian system, which controls body\nprocesses, such as digestion, the release of certain hormones, body temperature and sleep. Humans evolved their sleep schedules to be dependent on the natural day- night cycle.\nElectric light has only been widely used as a source of light for less than 200 years.  The increase in the use of electric lighting has led to indoor environments relying on electric light\nover daylight. However, reduced exposure to light has been linked to the onset of depression and impairment of cognitive function in individuals.\n Irregular sleep-wake cycles have\nbeen linked to poorer academic performance in college students. Studies have shown that light exposure during daytime has been linked to increases in productivity and sleep quality,\nas well as reduction in symptoms of depression in individuals.\nSolutions : Providing indoor access to adequate light can positively influence the productivity and mood of individuals, while supporting the alignment of their circadian rhythms with the\nnatural day-night cycle.\n Access to appropriate levels of light in indoor environments can be achieved through building design, façade design, space layout and lighting design.\nWindows, atriums and skylights are design features that can be utilized to increase daylight in a space. The interior layout of the space also has an impact on the daylight exposure\nreceived by users. For example, conference rooms can be added to the center of the floor plate, so that workstations can be situated near windows and have daylight exposure. Lighting\nstrategies using electric lighting can be utilized to achieve required light exposure, when appropriate daylight exposure is not available.\nPART 1 PROVIDE INDOOR LIGHT\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nOption 1: Daylight simulation\nThe project demonstrates, through computer simulations, that one of the following conditions are achieved:\na.

The light levels in a space can enhance the user’s ability to\nperform tasks in that space, while contributing to the feeling of spaciousness. The age of the individual is also a factor in the amount of light required for visual acuity. As humans age, the\ntransmission of light through their lenses is reduced. This is due to age-related changes, including increased light absorption by the lenses, smaller pupil size, increased scattering of light\ndue to thicker lenses and yellowing of the lenses.\n This aging of the eye indicates that an increase in light levels is required to ensure visual acuity.\nSolutions : While developing a lighting strategy to accommodate the visual acuity of users, it is critical to take into account the tasks conducted, as well as the age of the users. Projects\nmay refer to published recommendations by lighting associations or authorities on using electric lighting design strategies for light levels required on the work plane. Lighting\nrecommendations published by authorities provide a range of lighting levels for different age groups and tasks.\nPART 1 PROVIDE VISUAL ACUITY\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nOption 1: Visual lighting design\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

Humans have evolved to base their circadian rhythms around the natural light-dark patterns associated\nwith daytime and night-time. However, with humans being indoors for extended periods of time, exposure to adequate levels of light have been compromised as typical indoor electric\nlight levels often do not equate to the amount of light the human body traditionally receives outdoors.  Light deficiencies affects the functioning of the circadian system and quality of\nsleep. Disruption of circadian rhythm has been linked with obesity, diabetes, depression and metabolic disorders.\n Exposure to light at night has also been associated with negative\nhealth effects, such as breast cancer, circadian phase disruption and sleep disorders.\n   \nSolutions : Since circadian response of humans to light is dependent on the light that enters the eye, factors such as spectral properties of the light, brightness levels, duration, and timing\nof exposure should be considered. The light levels must be achieved on the vertical plane, at the eye level of the occupant to simulate the light entering the eye of the user.\nIt is also\nimportant to consider the duration of exposure to light, as well as the timing of exposure. Stimulating the circadian system at night through exposure to bright light can negatively\nimpact sleep quality.\nPART 1 MEET LIGHTING FOR DAY-ACTIVE PEOPLE (MAX : 3 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nFor workstations used during the daytime, electric lighting is used to achieve the following thresholds:\na. The following light levels are achieved for at least four hours (beginning by noon at the latest) at a height of {{well-\nunit}}18 in|45 cm{{/well-unit}} above the work-plane for all workstations in regularly occupied spaces:\nTier Threshold\n \nThreshold for Projects with Enhanced Daylight\nPoints\n1\nAt least 150 EML [136\nmelanopic EDI]\nOR At least 120 EML [109 melanopic EDI] and either\nL05 Part 1 or L06 Part 1\n{{well-points}} 1|2\n{{/well-points}}\n2\nAt least 275 EML [250\nmelanopic EDI]\nOR At least 180 EML [163 melanopic EDI] and either\nL05 Part 1 or L06 Part 1\n{{well-points}}\n3|4{{/well-points}}\nb. The light levels are achieved on the vertical plane at eye level to simulate the light entering the eye of the\noccupant.\nNote : Refer to the Performance Verification Guidebook for information on sensor/testing requirements, required testing duration and compliance calculations.\nFor Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nThe following requirements are met in each dwelling unit:\na.    Electric lighting is used to achieve the following light levels:\nTier Threshold\n \nThreshold for Projects with Enhanced Daylight\nPoints\n1\nAt least 150 EML [136 melanopic\nEDI]\nOR At least 120 EML [109 melanopic EDI] and either L05 Part 1\nor L06 Part 1\n1\n2\nAt least 275 EML [250 melanopic\nEDI]\nOR At least 180 EML [136 melanopic EDI] and either L05 Part 1\nor L06 Part 1\n3\nb. The light levels are dimmable. If automated lighting is used, it is automatically dimmed after 8:00 pm. \nc. The light levels are achieved in living rooms and kitchens at a height of {{well-unit}}55 in|140 cm{{/well-unit}} in\nthe center of the room. For studio apartments and guestrooms without living rooms, also test in the center of the\nroom.

Reducing\nglare improves the visual experience of the occupants in the space. Glare has been associated with a host of health issues that range from visual discomfort and eye fatigue to headaches\nand migraines.\nStudies have also shown that glare can lead to visual impairment and discomfort, which can cause accidents in the workplace. Individuals under the age of 50 are more\nsensitive to glare.  Since a substantial section of the workforce falls into this age group, it is important to address glare to avoid visual fatigue and glare-induced headaches.\nSolutions : Electric lighting, the light source, type of luminaires and lighting layout can help to reduce glare. \nPART 1 MANAGE GLARE FROM ELECTRIC LIGHTING (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Industrial:\nOption 1: Luminaire considerations\nAll luminaires within regularly occupied spaces (excluding wall wash fixtures, concealed fixtures, emergency lighting\nand decorative fixtures installed as specified by the manufacturer) meet one of the following requirements when\nmeasured at light output representative of regular use conditions:  \na. 100% of light is emitted above the horizontal plane.\nb.

It\nalso provides individuals with a connection to outdoor spaces through windows.\nIssue : Humans spend approximately 90% of their time indoors.  The way buildings are designed has an enormous impact on occupant exposure to daylight.  Exposure to daylight has\nbeen proven to have a substantial impact on mood, circadian health and productivity.\n Studies have associated lack of exposure to daylight with a disruption in the circadian rhythms of\nhumans and a decrease in quality of sleep. Rooms with large windows also reduce recovery time for patients suffering from severe depression and those recuperating after heart attacks,\ncompared to similarly afflicted patients in rooms with windows facing buildings or other obstructions.\nWindow characteristics have also been found to have an impact on students'\nperformance in schools. Students have been shown to perform better, when they have access to windows that can be opened.\nStudies also show strong links between quality of views\nin office environments and performance of employees.  Indoor spaces with daylight exposure have been shown to have fewer bacteria, compared to spaces without any light\nexposure.\nSolutions : Building design and interior layout have a substantial impact on the amount of daylight in an indoor space. Indoor daylight should be accounted for at all stages of building\nplanning from architectural and façade design to interior design and layout. Indoor daylight planning should be coupled with glare control strategies, such as integrating shading for all\nwindows. \nPART 1 IMPLEMENT DAYLIGHT PLAN (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nThe following requirement is met:  \na.

Exposure to daylight has been proven to have a substantial impact on mood,\ncircadian health and productivity.\n Studies have associated lack of exposure to daylight with a disruption in the circadian rhythms of humans and a decrease in sleep quality. Students\nhave been shown to perform better when they have access to windows that can be opened.  Indoor spaces with daylight exposure have been shown to have fewer bacteria, compared\nto spaces without any light exposure.   \nSolutions : Building design and planning has a substantial impact on the amount of daylight in an indoor space. With the myriad of solutions available for daylight ingress and shading,\nindoor daylight exposure can be optimized by conducting simulations. Daylight simulations can inform choices for shading, support fenestration design, as well as the interior layout of a\nspaces.\nPART 1 CONDUCT DAYLIGHT SIMULATION (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nThe project demonstrates, through computer simulations, that the following conditions are achieved:\na.

Lighting is planned across spaces to\nachieve the required ambience and energy efficiency goals. However, fluctuating light levels impact the visual comfort of occupants and could lead to eye fatigue.  Sudden increases and\ndecreases in brightness can cause a high level of visual discomfort.  Constant changes in lighting have been linked to distraction from the task at hand, which can decrease productivity\nand impact well-being.\nSolutions : Development of a lighting layout and operations schedule to complement the lighting design in a space is key to increasing the comfort of users. Evidence suggests that\nthoughtful planning of lighting in a space that takes into account color temperature, daylight and electric light supports a visually comfortable lighting environment.\n Consideration of\nthe ages of users, tasks performed and existing physical features in the space are also integral to creating a productive space.\nPART 1 BALANCE VISUAL LIGHTING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Parameters for visual balance\nAmbient lighting in all regularly occupied spaces meets at least three of the following requirements:  \na. Horizontal and vertical luminance contrast ratios for an ambient light system is no more than 10:1 between\nadjacent independently controlled zones.\nb. Illuminance uniformity ratio of at least 0.4  or 1:2.5 (minimum light level: average light level) is achieved on any\nhorizontal task plane within a space.\nc. One of the following: 1. A lighting automation system is in use and automatic changes in lighting characteristics,\nsuch as light levels, changes in color and distribution take place over a period of at least 10 minutes.   2. A lighting\nautomation system is not in use. \nd. The Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) in each room for similar fixtures is consistent (±200 K) at any point of\ntime.\nOption 2: Design for visual balance\nLighting is designed by a lighting professional and takes into account the following considerations:\na. Luminance ratios on vertical and horizontal adjacent zones.\nb. Illuminance uniformity on horizontal task planes.\nc. Changes in lighting characteristics, such as light levels, changes in color and distribution.\nd. Correlated Color temperature (CCT) of lights used.\nREFERENCES\n1. Kim SY, Kim JJ.

Humans are tuned to the color rendering provided by daylight and recognize colors in\nassociation with daylight.  Color can impact peoples' cognition and behavior.  Using electric light with high color rendering can improve people's perception of a space, and low color\nrendering can impact the ability to differentiate between objects and perceive the surroundings accurately. Electric lighting used indoors also has low frequencies of flicker that are not\npresent in daylight. Flicker has been associated with eye strain, headaches, migraines and epileptic seizures.\n In 2016, migraines accounted for 16 million disability adjusted life years\n(DALYs) in men and 30 million DALYs inwomen.\nSolutions : Identifying and utilizing lighting fixtures that emit a high quality of light and do not display signs of flicker contributes to a comfortable and healthy space. Light fixtures with\nhigher color rendering emit light that shows colors realistically. The CIE General Color Rendering Index (\"CRI\") and measures from IES TM-30 are commonly used to communicate the\ncolor rendering properties of a light source.\nPART 1 ENHANCE COLOR RENDERING QUALITY (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Circulation Areas:\nAll luminaires in occupiable spaces (except decorative fixtures, emergency lights and other lighting for signage) meet\nat least one of the following color rendering requirements. If tunable white lighting is used, the requirements are met\nat 1000 K intervals from the lower end (with a minimum of 2700 K) to the higher end (with a maximum of 5000 K):\na. CRI (R ) ≥ 90.\nb. CRI (R ) ≥ 80 and R9 (R ) ≥ 50.\nc. IES TM-30 P1 (i.e., R  ≥ 78, IES R  ≥ 95, -1% ≤ IES R\n ≤ 15%).\nFor Circulation Areas:\nAll luminaires (except decorative fixtures, emergency lights and other special-purpose lighting) meet at least one of\nthe following color rendering requirements:\na. CRI (R ) ≥ 80.\nb. P2 (i.e., IES R  ≥ 75, IES R  ≥ 92, -7% ≤ IES R\n ≤ 19%).\nPART 2 MANAGE FLICKER (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAll luminaires (except decorative lights, emergency lights and other lighting for signage) and their controls within\noccupiable spaces meet at least one of the following requirements:\na. Classified as “reduced flicker operation” per California Title 24, when tested according to the requirements in\nJoint Appendix JA-10.\nb.

Lighting in a space\nhas been shown to have a positive impact on mood and cognitive performance.\nLighting environments that are customizable by individuals have been shown to improve satisfaction\nlevels.  The ages of occupants have an impact on the light levels required for visual acuity.\n Lighting guidelines recommend twice the light levels for individuals over the age of 65 years,\ncompared to individuals between the ages of 25 years and 65 years.\n As humans age, the transmission of light through their lens is reduced. This is due to age related changes, including\nincreased light absorption by the lenses smaller pupil size, increased scattering of light due to thicker lenses and yellowing of the lenses.\nSolutions : Developing a lighting environment that not only seeks to satisfy the visual and circadian requirements of individuals, but also creates a customizable environment helps to\nimprove productivity, mood and well-being. Innovative lighting strategies, including the customization of a user’s immediate environment, can contribute to occupant satisfaction with\nthe space. Creating zones with lighting conditions that are distinct from the lighting in regular workspaces, can create a comfortable and informal environment that individuals can\nutilize for social interaction. Lighting environments can help to improve mental health, reduce stress and improve visual acuity.\nPART 1 ENHANCE OCCUPANT CONTROLLABILITY (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Lighting zones\nAmbient lighting systems meet the following requirement:\na.

Lighting systems have at least three lighting levels or scenes that allow for changes in light levels.\nb. ​Lighting systems have the ability to change at least one of the following:\n1. Color.\n2. Correlated color temperature (CCT).\n3. Distribution of light by controlling different groups of lights or through preset scenes.\nc. All regular occupants have control over their immediate lighting environment through at least one of the\nfollowing:\n1. Manual controls (e.g. switches or control panels) located in the same space as each lighting zone.\n2. Digital interface available on a computer or phone.\nd.   Lighting for presentation or projection walls are separately controlled.\nNote :\nProjects may identify spaces within the project boundary where lighting controls are limited to certain regular\noccupants (e.g., facilities staff, office manager) provided that these spaces do not make up more than 10% of the\nproject size.\nPART 2 PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\n1: Supplemental lighting availability\nThe project meets the following requirements:\na.

This\nmetric was proposed by Lucas and others (Lucas et al., \"Measuring and using light in the melanopsin age.\" Trends in\nNeuroscience, Jan 2014). The authors provided a toolbox which for a desired spectrum derives equivalent “α-opic” lux\nfor each of the five photoreceptors in the eye (three cones, rods, and the ipRGCs). \nEML is dependent on the light intensity as well as the spectral power density of light at the measurement point. Given\na spectrum of light, each equivalent α-opic lux is related to each other by a constant called Melanopic Ratio (R).\nTo calculate the equivalent melanopic lux (EML), multiply the photopic lux (L) designed for or measured in a building\nby this constant (R): EML = L × R. \nProjects may use spreadsheets published by the authors of the journal article or IWBI for this calculation.\nPage 98 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

Physical activity includes various domains such as\noccupational, transportation, household and leisure-time activities. Our understanding of the relationship between\nphysical activity and health continues to evolve. We now know that all movement matters for health and that physical\nactivity can be accumulated through the day in a variety of ways.  Therefore, it is critical that our buildings,\ncommunities and surrounding environments support movement as a vital part of the human condition – and as a key\nhealth promotion tool. \nPhysical inactivity has been a primary focus within the public health community for decades, due to its contribution to\npre-mature mortality and chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, stroke,\ndementia and some forms of cancer.\n Despite the widely understood benefits of regular physical activity, global\nestimates from 2016 show that nearly a quarter (23%) of the adult population are physically inactive.  Rates of physical\ninactivity differ between developed and developing countries, where 29% and 15% of the population are estimated to\nbe inactive, respectively.  Compared to adults, adolescents and older populations exhibit even higher levels of\nphysical inactivity – about 80% and 53%, respectively.  In 2013, it is estimated that physical inactivity cost the\nhealthcare systems globally about $54 billion and contributed to nearly $14 billion in productivity losses.  The reasons\nfor these trends are complex and numerous. Shifts in economic conditions and daily living patterns at both global and\nnational levels can impact health behaviors. For example, rising urbanization and economic development are\nassociated with declining physical activity levels.\nSedentary behavior is also rising. Sedentary behavior is distinct from physical inactivity and is characterized as very\nlow-intensity, low-effort activities, such as sitting.  In a study published in 2011, self-reported time spent sitting\nranged from 3-9 hours per day among adults, globally.  It is also has distinct biology, physiology and associated health\noutcomes. Sedentary behavior has been linked to poor health outcomes, including obesity, type II diabetes,\ncardiovascular risks and premature mortality.\nOur current work to combat physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors adopts a systems-thinking approach bringing\ntogether experts from varied disciplines: from ergonomists to exercise scientists, urban planners to architects,\nbehavior change experts to workplace wellness champions, epidemiologists to policy experts and grass roots\ncommunity organizers to Fortune 500 companies.\n \nThe WELL Movement concept aims to promote movement, foster physical activity and active living and discourage\nsedentary behavior, by creating and enhancing opportunities through the spaces where we spend our lives. The\nimpact of changing the global physical activity narrative is substantial. Worldwide, if physical inactivity were reduced\nby 10%, more than half a million deaths could be averted, while over one million deaths could be averted, if physical\ninactivity was reduced by 25%. Furthermore, the elimination of physical inactivity has been predicted to increase the\nglobal lifespan by an average of 0.68 years.\n \nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Movement Concept. Note: Material from the research digests is not covered on the WELL AP exam.\nREFERENCES\n1.

In addition, our homes, schools, workplaces, communities, jobs and transportation systems have been physically designed to demand less movement and require more\nsedentary activities.\nSolutions : We have come to understand that our environments play a significant role in physical activity behaviors.\n Active design considers how different components of a building,\nsuch as staircases can encourage movement.  At a community scale, active design considers the ways in which communities can encourage populations to be active through public\ninfrastructure, such as cycle lanes and green space. These factors, beyond physical activity promotion, also positively impact environmental, social and economic outcomes.\n The\nimpact of changing the global physical activity narrative is substantial. Worldwide, if physical inactivity were reduced by just 10%, more than half a million deaths could be averted, while\nover one million deaths could be averted, if physical inactivity were reduced by 25%.\nPART 1 DESIGN ACTIVE BUILDINGS AND COMMUNITIES\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project achieves at least one point in one of the following features:\na.

In manual labor work environments, risk factors\ninclude heavy lifting, bending, reaching overhead and pushing or pulling heavy objects.  In office settings, risk factors are no less prevalent and include workstation design that forces the\nbody into awkward positions along with other occupational factors that expose the body to prolonged or repetitive tasks.\nSolutions : An ideal ergonomic work environment is conducive to the necessary breadth of tasks assigned to that space, while encouraging movement through a variety of positions\nthroughout the day. Effective ergonomic interventions that support all users include both design (e.g., adjustable furniture) and programmatic (e.g., education) approaches.\n Ergonomic\ndesign solutions facilitate customizability at workstations allowing users to better fit workstations to their needs. Preliminary studies have demonstrated an ROI for ergonomics\ninterventions. One study found a return of $10 USD for every $1 USD invested.  A different study examining outcomes across 250 case studies found generally positive results, including a\nreduction in the number (49.5% across 37 studies) and cost (64.8% across 22 studies) of work-related MSDs, and also noted that the payback period was generally less than one year.\nPART 1 SUPPORT VISUAL ERGONOMICS\nFor Office Spaces:\nThe project meets the following requirements: \na. Workstations where desktop computers are used provide support for user adjustability (monitor height, viewing\nangle, horizontal distance) through one of the following:\n1. Monitors with built-in height and angle adjustment.\n2. Monitor stands or arms that allow height, angle and horizontal adjustment.\nb. Workstations where laptops are primarily used provide support for user adjustability through at least one of the\nfollowing:\n1. An external keyboard, mouse and laptop stand such that the laptop screen can be positioned by the user\n(screen height, viewing angle, horizontal distance).\n2. An external monitor that meets requirement a.\n \nPART 2 PROVIDE HEIGHT-ADJUSTABLE WORK SURFACES\nFor Office Spaces:\nAt least 25% of all workstations can be adjusted by the user for both seated and standing work, through one of the\nfollowing:\na. Manual or electric height-adjustable work surfaces that provide users with the ability to customize workstation\nheight at both seated and standing positions.\nb. Supplemental solutions (e.g., stand) that allow all or part of the work surface, monitor and primary input devices\n(e.g., keyboard, mouse) to be raised or lowered to seated or standing heights.\n  \nPART 3 PROVIDE CHAIR ADJUSTABILITY\nFor Office Spaces:\nAll seating at workstations meets the following requirements:  \na. The seat height is adjustable.\nb. One of the following:  i. The seat pan depth is adjustable.  ii. The seat pan depth is {{well-unit}}16.9 in|43\ncm {{/well-unit}} or less.\nc. One of the following:\n i. The backrest lumbar support is height adjustable. ii. The backrest angle is adjustable. iii.\nThe armrest height and distance between armrests are adjustable.\nPART 4 PROVIDE SUPPORT AT STANDING WORKSTATIONS\nFor All Spaces except Commercial Kitchen Spaces:\nOption 1: Support for standing workers\nAll workstations in which users are regularly required to stand for 50% or more of their working hours (e.g., assembly\nline station, hotel check-in counter, supermarket check-out counter) incorporate at least two of the following:\na. Anti-fatigue mats, impact reducing flooring or a similar strategy.\nb. Recessed toe space of at least {{well-unit}}4 in|10 cm{{/well-unit}} depth and height.13\nc. A footrest or footrail.\nd.

At the design level,\nthoughtful stair placement, especially in new construction, can significantly enhance movement opportunities throughout the day. Evidence-based guidelines, such as the Active Design\nGuidelines suggest that stairs should be proximate to main entry points and located physically and visibly before elevator or escalator banks.\nPART 1 DESIGN AESTHETIC STAIRCASES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n  At least one staircase is open to regular occupants, services all occupiable floors of the project and is aesthetically\ndesigned through the inclusion of at least two independent strategies from the following list on each floor: \na. Music.\nb. Artwork.\nc. Designed to have light levels of at least {{well-unit}}9fc|100 lux{{/well-unit}} when in use.\nd. Windows or skylights that provide access to daylight and/or nature views.\ne. Natural design elements (e.g., plants, water features, images of nature).\nf. Gamification.\nNote : Interiors projects may earn this feature either through stairs within the project boundary or through base building stairs outside of the project boundary. Stairs must service all\nfloors of the project but do not need to be accessible from the ground floor of the building. \nPART 2 INTEGRATE POINT-OF-DECISION SIGNAGE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least one staircase is open to regular occupants, services all occupiable floors of the project and is supported by\nthe following:\na. Motivational, point-of-decision signage is present at the following locations:\n1. Near the main building entrance or the reception desk.\n2. At elevator or escalator banks on each floor.\n3. At the base of stairs and stairwell re-entry points on each floor.\nb. If stairs are not visible from signage locations, wayfinding signage is used to guide occupants to the stairs.\nNote : Interiors projects may earn this feature either through stairs within the project boundary or through base building stairs outside of the project boundary. Stairs must service all\nfloors of the project but do not need to be accessible from the ground floor of the building. If the project does not access the stairs from the ground floor, they are exempt from\nrequirement a1, which requires signage on the ground floor.\nPART 3 PROMOTE VISIBLE STAIRS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least one staircase is open to regular occupants, services all occupiable floors of the project and meets the\nfollowing requirement:\na. Is at least as prominent (visual or physical) as elevators/escalators relative to the main point of entry to the building\nor project space (e.g., entrance to the project on their floor).\nNote : Interiors projects may earn this feature either through stairs within the project boundary or through base building stairs outside of the project boundary.

From 2000-2016, federal funding in the U.S.\nfor pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure increased from 0.1% to 2.2% of transportation spending, which translated to an increase in those walking and biking to work.  However, research\nsuggests that many communities still lack sufficient funding and infrastructure to support active commuting intentions.  For example, safety concerns, everyday transportation patterns,\nand a lack of bike parking and post-commute facilities often discourage cycling to work.\nSolutions : In a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic, studies reported that availability of amenities, such as bike parking and showers had a positive impact on cycling.\nProjections from one study showed that compared to baseline (5.8%), outdoor parking would increase those cycling to work to 6.3%, indoor, secure parking to 6.6% and indoor parking\nplus showers to 7.1%.  In addition, lockers and changing/shower facilities, in particular, support activity goals and behaviors not only for cyclists but all occupants, such as those who\nmight engage in physical activity or exercise before work. Such amenities signal to occupants that physical activity and, in particular, active commuting, is welcomed and encouraged.\nThoughtful site planning and selection can also enhance opportunities for cycling. The presence of cyclist infrastructure, such as cyclist lanes and, in particular, infrastructure that\npromotes cyclist safety, is known to increase ridership.\nPART 1 PROVIDE CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Retail Spaces:\n1: Cycling network\nOne of the following requirements is met:\na.

In\naddition to interior active design, the context in which a WELL project is situated, including neighborhood and site-level factors, plays an integral role in physical activity opportunities\nand choices.\nSolutions : The impact of thoughtful site planning, design and selection reaches beyond positive impacts on physical activity and active living, improving nearly every aspect of\ncommunity health and vitality from community connectedness to economic development.\n There is no single metric or recipe that defines a walkable community. Features of walkable\nneighborhoods vary throughout the literature but centralize around several core design themes: proximity, connectivity, density, safety and aesthetics.\n Walkable communities consider\nthe needs of all users and abilities and are designed to facilitate mobility across the lifespan. Communities can be evaluated at different scales, down to the street and building scale.\nSingle buildings can actually have important contributions to the streetscape. Buildings that activate the first level by incorporating aesthetic design can make positive contributions to\nthe pedestrian environment.\nPART 1 SELECT SITES WITH PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY STREETS (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Pedestrian-friendly streets\nAt least one functional building entrance opens to a pedestrian network (i.e., streets where pedestrians travel\nfeaturing, at a minimum, sidewalks) and meets at least one of the following requirements:\na. The project's address achieves a minimum Walk Score® of 70. To utilize this tool, projects must be located in a\ncountry that is \"supported\" by the tool. \nb. Opens onto a street with restricted vehicular traffic.\nc.

At least eight existing use types (as defined in Appendix V1) are present.\n2. Speed limits of {{well-unit}}25 mph|40 kmh{{/well-unit}} or less and street has buffer protections along\nsidewalks (e.g., curb extension, bioswales, bike lane, parked cars, benches, trees, planters).\n3. Street segments intersect one another (excluding alleys) at least every {{well-unit}}260-330 ft|80-100\nm{{/well-unit}}.\n2: Pedestrian-friendly environment\nExterior building walls facing the pedestrian network incorporate one or more of the following on the first floor or\nfirst {{well-unit}}18 vertical feet|5.5 vertical m{{/well-unit}} (whichever is less):\na. Windows or glazing that provide transparency into the space.\nb. Overhangs such as canopies, awnings, eaves or shades.\nc. Murals or other artistic installations.\nd. Biophilic design elements (e.g., plants, water features, nature patterns, natural building materials).\ne. Mixed building textures, colors and/or other design elements.\nNote : Interiors projects may count base building amenities toward feature requirements.\nPART 2 SELECT SITES WITH ACCESS TO MASS TRANSIT (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project meets at least one of the following requirements:\na. The project's address achieves a minimum Transit Score® of 70. To utilize this tool, projects must be located in\ncountry that is \"supported\" by the tool.\nb. Is located within a {{well-unit}}650 ft|200 m{{/well-unit}} walk distance of existing bus network that provides at\nleast 72 trips on each weekday and 30 trips on each weekend day.\nc.

Key determinants of physical activity behavior include\ntime, convenience, motivation, self-efficacy, weather conditions, travel and family obligations, fear of injury, lack of social support and environmental barriers such as availability of\nsidewalks, parks and bicycle lanes.\n In a review conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two studies highlighted economic benefits of workplace programs,\nincluding reduced healthcare costs, decreased costs and days lost due to disability, reduced absenteeism and increased productivity.\nSolutions : The workplace is considered an effective platform to reach a broad segment of the adult population.  Therefore, workplace wellness programs and offerings are considered\ngreat steps toward decreasing barriers to physical activity engagement among employees.  The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends worksite programs that make\nphysical activity more readily available (e.g., providing health club memberships, changing insurance benefits, providing opportunities to be physically active) as a strategy to improve\nphysical activity engagement.   Similar to the workplace, schools represent a ubiquitous platform to reach adolescents and youth.  The Community Preventive Services Task Force\nrecommends classroom-based teaching strategies and physical education curricula that incorporate activity as promising strategies to increase physical activity among adolescents.\nWhen considering physical activity education and programming, it's important to take into account the characteristics and preferences of the intended population. Events and education\nshould be relevant to the community (i.e., ability and age-appropriate). Projects should also seek to solicit on-going feedback from their population and make an effort to consider\nfeedback in revisions to programmatic offerings. \nPART 1 OFFER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPPORTUNITIES (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nNo cost physical activity opportunities are available to regular occupants and meet the following requirements:\na.

Despite widely disseminated guidelines,\nnearly a quarter of the general population fails to achieve recommended physical activity levels.  Key determinants of physical activity behavior include time, convenience, motivation,\nself-efficacy, weather conditions, travel and family obligations, fear of injury and lack of social support.\n At a community scale, additional environmental barriers exist, such as\navailability of sidewalks, parks and bicycle lanes.\nSolutions : In a systematic review conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, creating enhanced places for physical activity increased engagement and\nbiomarkers for physical fitness, including aerobic capacity and energy expenditure, with a few studies documenting some decrease in body weight and body fat.  Creating space within a\nbuilding for physical activity is important, along with larger efforts to design communities to encourage movement. Factors such as proximity and quality of parks are important\npredictors of physical activity, although more consistent research is needed.\nPART 1 PROVIDE INDOOR ACTIVITY SPACES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: On-site physical activity spaces\nA dedicated fitness facility is available within the project boundary at no cost to regular occupants and is sized\naccording to one of the following requirements:\na. The space includes at least two types of exercise or sporting equipment (e.g., free weights, treadmill, yoga mat,\nbasketball) in quantities that allow use by at least 5% of regular occupants at any time.\nb. The space includes at least two types of exercise or sporting equipment (e.g., free weights, treadmill, yoga mat,\nbasketball).

{"feature": "V09", "page_start": 118, "page_end": 119, "content": "V09 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROMOTION | O (MAX : 1 PT )\nIntent : Encourage physical activity and exercise, by designing, implementing and monitoring physical activity incentive programs.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects to provide physical activity incentives or promotion programs and monitor uptake of offerings.\nIssue : Physical inactivity has emerged as a primary focus of public health, due to a rise in premature mortality and chronic diseases attributed to inactive lifestyles, including type 2\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, stroke and some forms of cancer.\n Physical activity is intimately tied to prevention of these chronic conditions and overall health across the\nlifespan.  In adolescent populations, physical activity is especially important for health, well-being and development.\nSolutions : Health promotion programs in the workplace typically take a comprehensive approach to behavior change, including environmental design and behavioral strategies.\nThere isn’t a templatized program that can be applied and deliver results in every workplace.  It is, therefore, critical that projects take an integrative approach and design a program\nthat takes into account the characteristics and preferences of the intended users. Physical activity incentives are one of many strategies that can be used. In a systematic review\nexamining different incentives, conditional incentives – particularly those that rewarded positive physical activity behavior – were effective at improving physical activity levels as\ncompared to unconditional incentives (e.g., subsidized memberships that do not require participation).    Just as workplaces are a ubiquitous platform to reach working populations,\nprograms targeting schools are a key avenue to reach student populations.  In schools, some of the most common and well-recognized strategies to provide physical activity\nopportunities are through physical education curricula, recess, afterschool programs and sport, and activation of classrooms to incorporate more movement.\n It’s also recommended\nthat schools incorporate programs that address sedentary behavior, such as screen time, as part of a comprehensive approach to health promotion.  \nPART 1 OFFER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INCENTIVES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Incentives for eligible employees\nThe project or organization offers at least two of the following physical activity promotion programs to eligible\nemployees:\na. Rewards for physical activity engagement (e.g., prizes, financial rewards).\nb. A subsidy towards physical activity costs incurred by employees (e.g., membership fees or group fitness classes),\nincluding those incurred during business travel.\nc. Reductions in health care premiums based on physical activity engagement.\nd. Flexible work hours to accommodate physical activity.\ne. Paid time off for physical activity with a minimum of four days per calendar year. Days must be used towards\nphysical activity engagement or recovery and may not be deducted from regular paid time off or other employer-\nprovided time off from work (e.g., sick leave, standard paid holidays).\n2: Employee utilization of incentive programs\nOne of the following requirements is met:\na. The project or organization monitors utilization of incentive programs and demonstrates an annual utilization rate\nof 50% (i.e., at least 50% of eligible employees have utilized at least one incentive over the past year). Projects may\nreport combined utilization rates across multiple incentives, as appropriate.\nb. The project or organization demonstrates an annual improvement in utilization of at least 10 percentage points.\nProjects may report combined utilization rates across multiple incentives, as appropriate.\n3: Physical activity for students\nEarly childhood education, primary and secondary schools develop and implement the following programs for\nstudents:\na. A program that aims to reduce daily time spent in the following sedentary behaviors:\n1. TV viewing.\n2. Recreational computer or smartphone use.\n3. Gaming.  \nb. A program that aims to promote daily physical activity through at least one of the following:\n1. Teaching strategies that incorporate movement and activity into the lesson.\n2. Physical education.\n3. Recess or similar physical activity breaks. \nREFERENCES\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Facts about Physical Activity | Physical Activity | CDC.

Evidence\nsuggests that self-reported measures tend to overestimate actual physical activity behaviors.\nSolutions : Objective, accelerometer-based tools that track physical activity have proliferated the marketplace.\nEstimates from 2016 indicate 33% of people across 16 countries\n(including 20,000 individuals) used a wearable or app to track physical activity and health parameters.\n In addition, an estimated 44.5% of employers leverage them in strategic\nplanning of wellness programs.  Evidence from a systematic review conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that, particularly when paired with coaching\nand counseling, technology tools can have a positive impact on recording reliable data and improving health outcomes.  In a comprehensive review led by the U.S. Physical Activity\nGuidelines Committee, researchers found evidence that wearable activity monitors, including simple step counters, when paired with goal-setting, were effective at increasing physical\nactivity.  In a meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials, use of a step counter paired with a step goal significantly reduced sedentary time among adults.\n Projects should\nconsider privacy and data security among users when they are vetting technologies to recommend to their occupants, and when projects may have access to users’ wearable data.\nPART 1 PROVIDE SELF-MONITORING TOOLS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization provides devices (e.g., wearable fitness tracker) to all eligible employees that meet the\nfollowing requirements:\na. Available at no cost or subsidized by at least 50%.\nb. Allow users to monitor their own metrics over time (i.e., provides a dashboard where individual metrics are\naggregated).\nc.

One study found that after implementing a macro-ergonomics intervention, claims over a 5-year period were reduced by 45% (200 fewer total claims) and researchers\ndetermined an ROI of 10:1 for the program. In this study, ROI calculations considered the compensation costs per claim, the number of preventive ergonomic evaluations performed and\nthe annual cost of the program.  Another study examining outcomes across 250 case studies, across a variety of sectors from healthcare (36) to offices (40), manufacturing facilities (87)\nand other industries, found generally positive results and noted that the payback period was generally less than one year.\nPART 1 IMPLEMENT AN ERGONOMICS PROGRAM (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Professional ergonomics support\nThe project or organization meets at least one of the following requirements:\na. Engages with a qualified professional ergonomist (which may be a consultant, contractor or other third-party).\nb.

Annual consultation with key stakeholders (e.g., human resources, workplace wellness, occupational safety,\nleadership, employees) who are involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of the ergonomics\nprogram.\nb. A task analysis performed by a qualified professional ergonomist to identify the job-related tasks that are\nperformed by occupants in the space.\nc. Accommodations for eligible employees to receive individual ergonomic assessments in the form of a self-\nassessment (e.g., reputable, third-party app), in-person assessment (e.g., at the workplace or home) or a virtual\nassessment (e.g., live video conference). Assessments are offered to employees at least annually and, as applicable,\nduring or after the following events:\n1. Employee on-boarding.\n2. Substantial equipment changes (e.g., purchase of a new chair) or workstation redesign. \n3. Change in health status (e.g., injury, presentation of symptoms of musculoskeletal issues, visual strain). \n4. Change in work environment (e.g., transition to or from full-time remote work). \nd. Ergonomic trainings (e.g., workshop, seminar, classes) delivered by a qualified professional ergonomist to\nemployees at least annually. \nPART 2 COMMIT TO ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS (MAX : 1 PT )\nNote :\nProjects may only achieve this part if Part 1 is also achieved.\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Informed Ergonomic Design\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The project or organization describes how Part 1 informed design-decisions within Feature V02: Ergonomics\nWorkstation Design and, as applicable, Feature V07: Active Furnishings.\nOption 2: Individual Ergonomic Needs\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The project or organization demonstrates a commitment to addressing the individual ergonomic needs of\nemployees identified through individual ergonomics assessments.\nb. The timeline for delivery of solutions is communicated to employees.\nPART 3 Β SUPPORT REMOTE WORK ERGONOMICS (MAX : 1 PT )\nNote :\nProjects may only achieve this part if Part 1 is also achieved.\n1,2\n3,4\n5\n6\n7,8\n9\n10\nOR\nPage 120 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

Its influence on the integumentary, endocrine\nand respiratory systems also allows thermal comfort to play a large role in our health, well-being and productivity.\nBeyond the scope of individual impact, the indoor thermal environment also impacts a buildings’ energy use, since\ncooling and heating in developed and many developing countries account for approximately half of a building’s\nenergy consumption. \nDespite technological advancements, great improvements in our understanding of thermal comfort in buildings and\nexisting standards establishing specific criteria indicating buildings should provide an acceptable thermal environment\nfor a minimum 80% of occupants,  many people still feel uncomfortable during the work day.\n In fact, studies have\nshown only 11% of the office buildings surveyed in the U.S. provided thermal environments that met accepted goals of\nhuman satisfaction.\nMoreover, as many as 41% of office workers have expressed dissatisfaction with their thermal\nenvironment.  Such levels of dissatisfaction may be detrimental not only to the individual but also the business at\nlarge, since leading research indicates that employees perform on average 15% poorer in hot conditions and on\naverage 14% poorer in cold conditions.  In contrast to those who are dissatisfied with thermal conditions, office\nworkers who are satisfied with their thermal environment can be more productive in the workplace.\nThermal comfort is subjective, which means that not everyone will be comfortable under the same conditions. This\nhighlights that a one-size-fits-all approach to thermal comfort in buildings invariably fails for large numbers\nof people.  A comfortable thermal environment that satisfies all occupants is challenging to achieve, due to individual\npreferences and possible spatial and temporal variations in the thermal environment.\n There is a need for a holistic\napproach to thermal comfort that can satisfy the individual preferences of all (or nearly all) building users. When\npossible, personal thermal comfort devices should be used. These have been shown to improve self-reported\nproductivity rates, decrease symptoms associated with sick building syndrome and increase thermal\ncomfort.\n  However, due to the difficulties of setting temperature levels that suit all individual preferences,  thermal\ncomfort  conditions should create baseline satisfaction for the largest number of people. Overall, systems should\nalways be designed with human-centric  thermal zoning in mind, helping to optimize the system’s\nthermal performance.\nThe WELL Thermal Comfort concept takes a holistic approach to thermal comfort and provides a combination of\nresearch-based interventions to help design buildings that address individual thermal discomfort and support human\nhealth, well-being and productivity.\nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Thermal Comfort Concept.

The thermal\nenvironment not only impacts comfort and productivity, but due to its linkages to integumentary, endocrine and respiratory body systems, thermal comfort can also cause a variety of\ndetrimental health outcomes.\n Overly warm indoor spaces are linked to increases in sick building syndrome symptoms, irregular heart rate, respiratory issues, fatigue and negative\nmood.  Cold work environments have been linked to increased effort and work towards maintaining proper posture and increased risk for chronic issues related to musculoskeletal\nhealth.\nSolutions : Thermal comfort standards utilize a model that provides a means of predicting whether humans in a mechanically conditioned space will be satisfied with the thermal\nenvironment based on six core parameters: air temperature, humidity, air movement, mean radiant temperature of surrounding surfaces, metabolic rate and clothing insulation.\nFor\nnaturally conditioned buildings, the adaptive thermal comfort model correlates human comfort directly with indoor operative temperature and outdoor temperature.\n Achieving\nthermal satisfaction among people requires some level of control over thermal comfort parameters in any given environment.\nPART 1 PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT\nFor All Spaces except Commercial Kitchen Spaces:\nOption 1: Performance verified environmental conditions\nThe following requirements are met, as applicable:\na. Mechanically conditioned regularly occupied spaces maintain thermal comfort conditions of PMV +/- 0.5 for at\nleast 90% of occupied hours in at least 90% of regularly occupied spaces.\nb.

Mixed-mode-conditioned spaces meet the requirements for both mechanically and naturally conditioned spaces,\nwhen each is in operation\nNote : Spaces with multiple occupant types may use the occupant characteristics of PMV—metabolic rate and clothing value—for the majority occupant type (e.g., a space with 30 diners\nand 5 servers may use the diners' metabolic rates and clothing values to determine the PMV for that space).\nOption 2: Long-term thermal data\nThe following requirements are met:\na. Project meets Feature T06 Thermal Comfort Monitoring.\nb. Sensor data demonstrate parameters meet one of the following: 1.     One of the PMV or temperature ranges\ndescribed in Option 1. Dry bulb temperature may be used in place of operative temperature. Naturally conditioned\nprojects must also measure outdoor air temperature. 2.     Dry bulb temperature is between {{well-unit}}70-77\n°F|21-25 °C{{/well-unit}} for occupied hours.\n The designed air velocity is not more than {{well-unit}}40 fpm|0.2\nm/s{{/well-unit}} at {{well-unit}}5.6 ft|1.7 m{{/well-unit}} above the floor.\nNote : Spaces with multiple occupant types may use the occupant characteristics of PMV—metabolic rate and clothing value—for the majority occupant type (e.g., a space with 30 diners\nand 5 servers may use the diners' metabolic rates and clothing values to determine the PMV for that space). Projects undergoing recertification which were previously awarded Feature\nT06 must consider all data collected since the previous certification.\nOption 3: Thermal comfort surveys\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The project achieves at least two points in Feature T02: Verified Thermal Comfort.\nFor Commercial Kitchen Spaces:\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The operative temperature in the kitchen does not exceed {{well-unit}}80 °F|27 °C{{/well-unit}}.\nNote :\nMultifamily residential projects may achieve WELL Certification at the Bronze or Silver level without testing in dwelling\n1,2\n3,4\n5\n1,6\n7\n8\n9,10 \n11,12\n13\n12\npma(out)\npma(out)\npma(out)\nOR\n14\nOR\nPage 125 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

Besides the six primary factors of\nthermal comfort, many secondary factors, such as age, sex, health condition, personal thermal adaptation and thermal history, including climatological origin, are considered as major\nsecondary factors.\nFactors, such as temperament, preferences, social and cultural norms and seasonal variation also play an important role in determining individual thermal\ncomfort.\nSolutions : Adopting holistic approaches through the provision of individual thermal control devices results in improved individual thermal comfort and in the expansion of the thermal\ncomfort acceptability limits.\n Individual thermal control also allows for a broader range of recommended indoor air temperatures, which is linked to energy savings potential.\n In\nlarger shared spaces, use of personalized equipment is a good strategy to give people the ability to better control their sensation and comfort.\n For example, the use of a chair\nequipped with fans allows the room air temperature to increase without compromising thermal comfort.\n In addition, flexible dress codes are important, because clothing insulation\nis also one of the primary forms of intervention for addressing suboptimal thermal conditions.\nPART 1 PROVIDE PERSONAL COOLING OPTIONS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nThe project provides all regular occupants with the ability to cool their individual environment through at least one of\nthe following:\na. A user-adjustable thermostat, which controls the environment for no more than one person and is connected to\nthe building’s mechanical cooling system or a more localized air conditioning unit.\nb. A desk, standing, pedestal or ceiling fan that does not increase air speed for other occupants.\nc. Chair with mechanical cooling system.\nd. Any other solution capable of affecting a PMV change of -0.5 within 15 minutes from activation, without changing\nthe PMV for other occupants.\nPART 2 PROVIDE PERSONAL HEATING OPTIONS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Commercial Kitchen Spaces & Dwelling Units:\nThe project provides all regular occupants with the ability to warm their individual environment through at least one\nof the following:\na. A user-adjustable thermostat, which controls the environment for no more than one person and is connected to\nthe building’s mechanical heating system. \nb. Electric parabolic space heater.\nc. Electric heated chair or footwarmers.\nd. Personal or shared blankets. Shared blankets are washed or disinfected at least weekly after use.\ne. Any other solution capable of affecting a PMV change of +0.5 within 15 minutes from activation, without changing\nPMV for other occupants.\nPART 3 ALLOW FLEXIBLE DRESS CODE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Commercial Kitchen Spaces & Dwelling Units:\nThe following requirement is met:\na. A flexible dress code policy is in place that allows regular occupants to dress for individual thermal preferences.\nREFERENCES\n1.

It is influenced by a surface material’s ability to absorb or emit radiant heat, the extent to which the\nsurface area is exposed to the person (view factor) and the temperatures of the surrounding objects. Uniform thermal radiation may be disrupted by cold windows, uninsulated walls,\nequipment and improperly sized heating panels, causing local thermal discomfort.  In addition, conventional \"all-air\" systems have a higher risk of draft discomfort, due to elevated\nindoor air velocity.  Studies show occupants have a 50% probability of indoor temperature satisfaction in spaces with radiant systems, compared to conventional “all-air” systems.   \nSolutions : Radiant heating systems are designed to affect mean radiant temperature, and thus the heat exchange with the people in the space, by supplying heat directly to the\nsurrounding surfaces of the floors, walls and ceilings. With radiant systems, the heat transfer due to radiation increases, while the heat transfer due to convection decreases. Buildings\nwith radiant systems have the advantage of quiet operation, low energy consumption and the capability of design integration with an independent ventilation system.  Coupling a radiant\nsystem with a dedicated air system separates the twofold role of the mechanical system controlling both heating/cooling and ventilation allowing for better control of the\nthermal environment. The use of radiant heating and cooling also reduces the number of allergens circulated in the air, since this type of system does not use forced air to distribute\nheating or cooling. \nPART 1 IMPLEMENT RADIANT HEATING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least 50% of the regularly occupied project area is heated with one or more of the following:\na. Radiant ceilings, walls or floors. \nb. Radiant panels which cover at least half of the wall or ceiling to which they are attached (does not include steam\nradiators).\nPART 2 IMPLEMENT RADIANT COOLING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least 50% of the regularly occupied project area is cooled with one or more of the following: \na.

Outdoor weather, indoor occupancy and\nbuilding physics and performance, including ventilation rates, are highly variable and have a direct impact on human perceptions of thermal comfort. To maintain ideal performance\nmetrics, projects should continuously gather data on thermal comfort parameters in order to inform remediation actions.\nSolutions : Building HVAC systems should be designed to monitor and control for variations in indoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity and air movement.\nThermal comfort monitoring can help building users to be aware of and promptly fix any deviations in thermal comfort metrics. These measures by themselves will not resolve the issue\nof potential thermal discomfort, but they certainly raise awareness and are an important first step toward a solution. In addition to having calibrated sensors, the positioning of the\nsensors plays an important role in the accurate assessment of the thermal environment.\nPART 1 MONITOR THERMAL ENVIRONMENT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Thermal comfort monitors\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

However, in warm temperature\nsettings, humidity can influence the degradation of building materials, the ability of the human body to release heat through evaporation and the level of discomfort from excess\nmoisture on the skin.\n If the humidity is too high, the human body has a limited capacity to cool down through sweating.  Warm and humid indoor spaces are also associated with\nmold and fungal growth. Moreover, humidity in warm spaces may promote the accumulation and growth of microbial pathogens, including bacteria and dust mites which can lead to\nodors and cause respiratory irritation and allergies in sensitive individuals.  Conversely, cold and dry spaces can lead discomfort and irritation of the airways, skin, eyes, throat and\nmucous membranes  and facilitate the spread of the influenza virus.\nSolutions : Buildings situated in climates with broad humidity ranges can maintain relative humidity within healthy and comfortable levels, by adding or removing moisture from the air.\nPART 1 MANAGE RELATIVE HUMIDITY (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Mechanical humidity control\nThe following requirement is met in all regularly occupied areas, except high-humidity areas:\na.

By replacing open spaces and vegetation with structures built of materials that retain\nheat, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island has developed in the urban landscape.\n The most prominent feature of an urban heat island is a sustained elevated temperature\nwhen compared to the immediately surrounding suburban or undeveloped areas.  This can lead to adverse health outcomes such as heat-related illness, fatigue, increased breathing and\nincreased heart rate.\n In addition, high-rise buildings also can concentrate prevailing winds to higher speeds that result in pedestrian discomfort and dangerous conditions.\nSolutions : Various strategies can be used to mitigate urban heat island effects and improve outdoor thermal comfort, including adding vegetation, providing shading structures,\nincreasing reflectance of building materials and introducing water features.  The use of trees or vegetation facilitates evapotranspiration and provides shade, contributing to lower\nsurface and air temperatures.  Co-benefits of introducing urban vegetation and green spaces include improved air quality, water quality (often via improved stormwater management)\nand savings in energy.  Shelter canopies address solar radiation and provide relief to thermal stress in extreme temperatures. A shaded surface can be up to 25 °C [45 °F] cooler than the\npeak temperature of a nearby unshaded surface.  Reducing surface temperatures of sidewalks, roadways and parking lots can be effectively achieved through a mixture of shading and\nhigh-albedo paving materials.\n Finally, water bodies can have a positive effect on microclimates in urban areas by moderating extreme temperatures. Small water bodies such as\nfountains, pools and ponds can regulate temperature fluctuations and help improve thermal comfort during days of extreme heat.\nStudies suggest that temperatures around and\ndownwind of water bodies can be 1–2°C [2–4°F] lower compared to surrounding areas.\n Computational fluid dynamics programs and other modeling tools can be used to predict the\nthermal conditions and likelihood of excessive wind and the effectiveness of countermeasures.\nPART 1 MANAGE OUTDOOR HEAT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Outdoor shading\nThe following areas (if present) are shaded for more than half of daylight hours each day by tree canopies, awnings, or\nother structures:\na.

At least 25% of all plazas, seating areas, exercise facilities with a contiguous area of less than {{well-unit}}2500\nft |230 m {{/well-unit}} and other outdoor areas of congregation.\nOption 2: Temperature modeling\nFor pedestrian pathways and building entrances, parking spaces, and plazas, seating areas, exercise facilities with a\ncontiguous area of less than {{well-unit}}2500 ft |230 m {{/well-unit}} and other outdoor areas of congregation,\nproject provides the following:\na. Highest expected measure of thermal perception for each month (e.g., highest Physiologically Equivalent\nTemperature, highest Universal Thermal Climate Index).\nb. If the highest measure of thermal perception is associated with “moderate” (or more severe) heat stress, a list of\ncountermeasures within at least two of the following categories and the expected reduction in heat stress that\nthey provide:\n1. Landscaping and greenery.\n2. Manufactured shading systems (e.g., canopies).\n3. Reflectance of manufactured surfaces (e.g., sidewalks, rooftops).\n4. Water features (e.g., ponds, fountains). \nNote :\nInterior projects may achieve this part if the grounds of the base building meet the requirements, even if they are\noutside of the interior project boundary.\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form).

Winds are not expected to exceed {{well-unit}}11 mph|5 m/s{{/well-unit}} for more than 5% of hours in the year in\nseating areas or 10% of hours on paths and parking lots.\nb.

By this definition, human perception of sound is paramount in shaping a sonic environment.\nOnly in recent years has it been determined that exposure to noise sources, such as traffic and transportation have\nbeen shown to hinder the health and well-being of people in a number of different ways.\n For instance, the effects of\nexterior noise from transportation or industrial sources have been linked to sleep disturbance, hypertension and the\nreduction of mental arithmetic skills in school-aged children.\n In one study taken from a sample size of 4,115\nparticipants, it was found that the risk for myocardial infarction was elevated in men from road traffic noise at night\nand in women by air traffic noise at night.  A number of studies have also indicated that internally generated noise is\na major cause of complaint and ultimately results in occupant dissatisfaction.\nSound within an enclosed space from sources, such as HVAC equipment, appliances and other occupants has been\nshown to hinder productivity, focus, memory retention and mental arithmetic in school children, university students\nand workplace occupants.\n In addition to airborne noise sources, impact of noise from adjacent activity,\nsuch as footfall, exercise or mechanical equipment vibration can create uncomfortable environments for occupants\nlocated nearby.\n Another common acoustical issue is lack of privacy within and between enclosed spaces. For\ninstance, research has indicated that occupants are generally dissatisfied when conversations can readily transmit\nbetween rooms or across an open office, thus hindering confidentiality or creating a distraction from tasks.\nInappropriate reverberation times and background sound levels in a space can impede speech intelligibility and cause\nstrain for occupants who may possess hearing impairments.\n Speech intelligibility is also a crucial element in\neducational facilities, where information is being presented to large audiences and aural comprehension is vital for\nmemory retention and task completion.\nWith the rise in hearing impairments and various other health concerns as a result of over-exposure to noise,\ndesigning a single space to meet the acoustical comfort needs of every individual is challenging. However, existing\nresearch into the effects of best-practice acoustical design within a space suggests that a holistic approach to\naddressing the issue of acoustical comfort in the built environment is achievable.\n The planning and\ncommissioning of an isolated and balanced HVAC system provides a firm baseline for the anticipated background\nnoise level in a given enclosure.\n With the fortification of façade elements, exterior noise intrusion can be subdued,\nmuch to the benefit of occupant comfort, health and productivity.\n Adding mass and glazing to partition\nelements, sealing gaps at connections and doors and providing airspace between enclosed spaces bolsters sound\nprivacy and increases occupant comfort.\n Replacing areas of hard surfaces in a space with absorptive materials\ncan reduce reflected sound energy and better facilitate acoustical privacy or, conversely, improve speech\nprojection.\n Consistent background sound levels can be introduced into a space using a sound masking system,\nthus improving the signal-to-noise ratio in favor of acoustical privacy between occupants.\nThe WELL Sound concept aims to provide a comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing the concerns of\nacoustical comfort through research-based design considerations that buildings can accommodate for the purposes\nof improving occupant health and well-being.\n \n \nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Sound Concept.

Similar conditions are reported in workplaces worldwide.\n Some reports have shown that occupants are less likely to help others under high noise conditions, reducing\ncollaboration in the workplace.\nSolutions : To address noise, floor plans should be designed with intent and use in mind.\n For example, a typical office can be categorized into four key types of programming: spaces for\nconcentration, collaboration, socialization and learning.  Location is important, since noise from social or collaborative spaces impacts spaces intended for concentration or\nlearning.\n  This approach can be implemented in any space type that incorporates spaces of socialization and recreation alongside areas for task-centric work or learning.\n These\nspaces can then be described as loud, quiet and mixed spaces to better assess the impact of sound on sensitive, quiet locations for concentration, learning or recreation.\nPART 1 LABEL ACOUSTIC ZONES\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project provides the following:\na. A floor plan or other design document showing the following acoustic zones throughout the project:\n1. Loud zone: includes areas intended for loud equipment or activities (e.g., mechanical rooms, AV/IT closets,\nkitchens, fitness rooms, social spaces, recreational rooms, music rooms).\n2. Quiet zone: includes areas intended for concentration, wellness, rest, study and/or privacy (e.g., restorative\nspaces, lactation rooms, nap rooms).\n3. Mixed zone: includes areas intended for learning, collaboration and/or presentation (e.g., auditoriums,\nclassrooms, breakout spaces).\n4. Circulation zone: includes occupiable areas not intended for regular occupancy (e.g., hallways, egress, atria,\nstairs, lobbies)\n5. Not applicable zones: includes other areas without significant sources of sound (e.g., storage rooms, janitor\nrooms, coat closets) that are not regularly occupied.\nb. A plan for reprogramming or mitigating sound transmission between loud zones that border quiet zones (if any).\nPART 2 PROVIDE ACOUSTIC DESIGN PLAN\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project provides one of the following:\na. A plan developed by the project team and/or project owner that outlines acoustical solutions and a timeline for\nimplementation with a focus on managing acoustical comfort, background noise, speech privacy, reverberation\ntime and/or impact noise within the project boundary. \nb. A detailed report from a professional in acoustics that describes existing conditions, recommended solutions and\nmeasurement results with a focus on managing background noise, speech privacy, reverberation time and/or\nimpact noise within the project boundary. These measurements are not required to adhere to the Performance\nVerification Guidebook requirements for on-site testing.\nREFERENCES\n1. Park SH, Lee PJ, Yang KS, Kim KW.

For instance, elevated levels of background noise can impact the perception of\npublic address systems and diminish the perception of spoken word, which reduces critical listening ability and task performance.\n Studies indicate that employees are unable to\nhabituate to noise in office environments over time and office noise, with or without speech, can create stress and disrupt performance on more complex cognitive tasks (e.g., memory\nof prose, mental arithmetic).\n Studies have shown that exposure to traffic noise can lead to increased risk of cardiovascular system issues, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, depression\nand high blood pressure.\n For children, chronic aircraft noise exposure impairs reading comprehension, mental arithmetic and proofreading.\nSolutions : Interior noise sources can be controlled by selecting HVAC equipment with lower sound ratings and by designing the system to reduce sound within ducts.\n Exterior noise\ncan be controlled by providing sound reduction at the building façade, windows and any exterior penetrations.\n In both cases, these sound sources are easier to control when\nconsidered at the earliest possible stages of design.\nPART 1 LIMIT BACKGROUND NOISE LEVELS (MAX : 3 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nNote :\nCategory 1 Room Types:\nAreas for conferencing\nAreas for learning\nAreas for speaking\nCategory 2 Room Types:\nEnclosed areas for concentration\nCategory 3 Room Types: \nOpen areas for concentration\nAreas with regularly used PA systems\nAreas for dining (excluding kitchenettes)\nCategory 4 Room Types:\nAreas with machinery and appliances used by occupants (e.g., baggage handling areas, security, commercial kitchens, kitchenettes, labs where spoken lectures do not take\nplace)\nThe following requirement is met:\na.

Walls with high sound transmission class ratings (STC) will provide sound\nisolation, only when the wall is constructed to reduce flanking at points where the wall connects to other building elements. Windows, glass fins or other penetrations diminish\nperformance and should be used sparingly. Doors also reduce performance of walls but can be fitted with gaskets and seals to reduce sound transmission, when the door is closed.\nRooms that require high speech privacy can use sound masking systems, in addition to high-performing walls to increase privacy.\nPART 1 DESIGN FOR SOUND ISOLATION AT WALLS AND DOORS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

The length of reverberation time is a function of room size, surface area\nand sound absorbing properties of surface finishes. Spaces with longer reverberation times may be larger in volume with hard surfaces that reflect sound. Spaces with shorter\nreverberation may be smaller with softer surfaces that absorb sound. Spaces with high reverberation may have increased ambient noise levels and reduce speech intelligibility (e.g., public\naddress, speech reinforcement and unamplified speech). Studies have shown that high reverberation times in classrooms increase auditory workload in students and reduce cognition,\nmemory retention and concentration.\n Similarly, studies have shown that high reverberation reduces speech intelligibility among hard of hearing and non-native speaking\npopulations.\nSolutions : Reverberation time can be controlled by adding absorptive surface finishes at ceilings, walls and furniture.\n Projects that can alter room geometry can change layouts and\nroom dimensions to support optimal reverberation times, as needed. Reducing reflective surfaces, such as glass, drywall, stone or similar, will also reduce reflected sound energy, which\nincreases reverberation time. Reducing reverberation time also allows audio equipment for telecommunication/AV, speech reinforcement or public address to operate with higher\nspeech intelligibility performance.\nPART 1 ACHIEVE REVERBERATION TIME THRESHOLDS (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units & Guest Rooms:\nOption 1: Reverberation time, design\nFor projects in which the room types listed in the table cumulatively make up at least 10% of occupiable project area,\nthe following requirements are met:\na.

When spaces are designed with hard reflective ceilings and walls, perception of noise increases\nwith an increase in ambient, reflected noise that decays in level at a longer rate.\n When open collaborative spaces lack acoustical absorption at ceilings or partial height barriers,\nworkers can become distracted by reflected sound, especially if that speech is perceptible.\n Conversely, in learning environments, reverberation can impair a listener’s comprehension\nof speech due to poor speech intelligibility, especially when listeners are hard of hearing, expending a greater auditory workload to process speech resulting in reduced task\nperformance.\n In rooms where teleconferencing or audio equipment introduces amplified sound, spaces without adequate acoustical treatment are subject to higher functioning\nbackground noise levels, which may be heard in neighboring spaces.\n Lack of reflected sound control in spaces for conferencing can impact the quality of speech intelligibility over\nteleconferencing equipment.\nSolutions : Providing acoustical treatment that significantly reduces sound across human speech frequencies can greatly reduce unwanted buildup of reflected sound.  Ceilings typically\nprovide the greatest area of coverage where highly absorptive materials can offer the best performance in reducing reverberation and controlling speech intelligibility and occupied\nnoise levels.\n Wall treatment can reduce reflections that impact performance of speech intelligibility with teleconferencing equipment.\nPART 1 IMPLEMENT SOUND REDUCING SURFACES (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nFor projects in which the room types listed in the table cumulatively make up at least 10% of occupiable project area,\nthe following requirements are met:\na.

Ambient background sound, which\ncan include artificial sound sources, can increase speech privacy to comfortable levels.\n However, ambient background noise provided by HVAC systems alone is shown to fluctuate by\nzone and by as much as 15 dBA or more in a given year.  Some HVAC systems, like chilled beams, offer little to no ambient sound contribution and result in quiet interiors, where speech\nis readily intelligible and distracting. In offices and patient rooms where speech privacy is critical between regularly occupied spaces, a combination of reliable background sound is\nneeded where partitions do not perform above a minimum STC-30.\nSolutions : Consistent background sound can be delivered to a space using an adjustable array of loudspeakers located such that sound is uniformly distributed.\n These systems are\nprogrammed to output a sound source similar to the sound of air flowing through HVAC. The sound source is broad-band and designed to elevate ambient background sound level to\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce speech perception between enclosed and open environments.\nPART 1 PROVIDE MINIMUM BACKGROUND SOUND (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor Office Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na. A sound masking system is installed in open areas and enclosed rooms designated as quiet zones, circulation\nzones and in areas where workstations are present.\nb. The sound masking system produces a 1/3 octave band adjustable output signal and minimum frequency\nspectrum of 100 Hz to 5 kHz.\nc. The sound masking system is commissioned such that the following sound pressure levels are not exceeded:\n1. Open areas designated as quiet zones, circulation zones and areas where workstations are present: 48 dBA.\n2. Enclosed rooms labeled as quiet zones: 42 dBA.\nd. The sound masking system is verified by a professional sound masking system installer in accordance with ASTM\n1573-18 or equivalent standard.\nPART 2 PROVIDE ENHANCED SPEECH REDUCTION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project achieves the following features and parts:\na.

This impact noise travels through structures (e.g., walls, floors, columns, piping) as\nvibrations that are then radiated as airborne noise to a listener.  Impact noise typically derives from objects impacting a floor (e.g., footfall, machinery, gym equipment) and can result in\nworkplace distractions, sleep disturbance or disrupted focus.\nSolutions : The overall construction of a building influences impact noise radiation levels. For example, a building that utilizes a light-weight floor construction (e.g., wood truss, cross-\nlaminated timber, steel frame) generally exhibits higher degrees of impact noise radiation between floors.\n Conversely, buildings constructed with resilient, composite floor-ceiling\nconstruction (e.g., thick concrete slab, suspended ceiling, floor with an underlayment) generally exhibit lower degrees of impact noise radiation. The performance of floor-ceiling\nmaterials can be measured using the following metrics: Impact Insulation Class Rating (IIC), Normalized Impact Sound Rating (NISR) or Weighted Standardized Impact Sound Pressure\nLevel (L\n).\nPART 1 SPECIFY IMPACT NOISE REDUCING FLOORING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na.

Reduced or low speech intelligibility can negatively impact occupant satisfaction\nand well-being, especially for non-native speakers, individuals with hearing loss or neurodiversity.\n Audio equipment used for communication can further decrease comprehension of\nspoken word when installed and used incorrectly.\n Additionally, increased auditory workload can impact task performance, resulting in a higher risk of misunderstanding,\noperational errors and accidents.\n In educational settings, increased vocal effort by teachers to overcome poor intelligibility has been linked to vocal strain, decreased job performance,\nlower quality of life, higher rates of leave or absence and resignation.\n Improving speech intelligibility can support classroom participation for deaf and hard-of-hearing students,\nwhich is linked to improved scores for quality of life, social contact with peers and mental health.\nSolutions : Implementing audio systems can improve speech intelligibility for end-users in various environments. These systems include teleconferencing equipment in offices, speech\nreinforcement systems in classrooms and public address systems.\n To provide the best possible outcomes for users, systems should be commissioned by a professional in audio\nengineering to effectively meet occupant needs and support a range of user experiences.\nPART 1 PROVIDE ENHANCED SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project meets the following requirements, as applicable:\na.

Estimates suggest that by\nthe year 2050 over 900 million people will have disabling hearing loss.  Typical environments where hazardous sound levels can occur include occupational settings where loud\nequipment is present (e.g., industrial spaces, airports, fitness studios), as well as settings where occupants regularly engage with personal listening devices (PLDs) that exceed safe\nlistening levels (e.g., call centers, distance learning, recreational devices). Presbycusis, also known as age-related hearing loss, comprises most hearing loss cases.\n Studies have shown\nthat individuals with hearing loss over the age of 65 are at higher risk to develop cognitive disorders like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.\n In all forms, hearing loss can lead to\nexclusion from communication and may impact social and emotional health by leading to feelings of loneliness, isolation and frustration, particularly among older populations.  The\nannual economic impact of hearing loss is an estimated US $750 billion, which accounts for costs related to healthcare (excluding the cost of hearing devices), educational support and\nloss of productivity and well-being.\nSolutions : Hearing health conservation programs that raise awareness about the risks of hearing loss and encourage individuals to use personal protective devices (e.g., earplugs,\nearmuffs) may help prevent noise induced hearing loss.\n Organization-wide programs that focus on the reduction of occupational noise exposure, provide access to regular hearing\nhealth screenings for vulnerable occupants and provide relevant staff with necessary training for use of loud equipment have been found to help limit disabling hearing impairments,\nreduce fatigue and in some cases improve morale and work efficiency.  Companies that deploy these programs have reported reductions in medical expenses and worker compensation\ncosts.\nPART 1 IMPLEMENT A HEARING HEALTH CONSERVATION PROGRAM (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Hearing health conservation program\nThe project maintains a hearing health conservation program that meets the following requirements:\na. Provides hearing protection that is selected, fitted and maintained for all occupants at no cost to the occupant.\nb. Demonstrates compliance with OSHA Code of Federal Regulations Title 29 Chapter XVII Part 1910 Subpart G,\nEuropean Council Directive 89/391/CEE or equivalent.\nc. Audiogram tests are made available to employees working in loud zones, at no cost in a room that meets ANSI\nS3.1-2018 (or equivalent) requirements for background noise levels, using calibrated audiometers as per the\nschedule below:\n1. Annually for all employees.\n2. Pre-employment or during onboarding for all new employees.\n3. Prior to initial assignment in a hearing-hazardous zone as determined by the hearing conservation program\nsupervisor (see below).\n4. At the time of reassignment out of a hearing-hazardous work area or job, as determined by the hearing\nconservation program supervisor (see below).\n5. At the conclusion of employment.\n2: Hearing health conservation supervisor\nThe project designates a qualified hearing health supervisor whose responsibilities include the following:\na. Coordinates at least one hearing health training (e.g., workshop, seminar) per year that educates all employees on\nthe following topics:\n1. Hearing loss and well-being.\n2. Audiometric results and hearing threshold levels.\n3. Noise exposure levels.\n4. Correct use of hearing protection.\nb. Manages the use and purchasing of hearing protection, audiometers and noise measuring equipment.\nc. Schedules annual audiometric evaluations for employees.\nd. Conducts an annual audit to determine that the hearing health conservation program adheres to OSHA, European\nDirective or equivalent regional regulations.\ne. Provides educational resources on hearing health to employees upon request.\nNote : This feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form).\nThe feedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that are effective and applicable to projects around the\nworld.\nREFERENCES\n1.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nMATERIALS\nThe WELL Materials concept aims to reduce human exposure, whether direct or through environmental\ncontamination, to chemicals that may impact health during the construction, remodeling, furnishing and operation of\nbuildings.\nThe chemicals industry is a central part of the global economy and is integral to a number of sectors that have played\na major role in improving life expectancy and the quality of life over the past 150 years. However, the health and\nenvironmental impacts of most chemicals in circulation, despite their ubiquity, are unknown. Many of the chemicals\nthat were ubiquitously used in the past have been found to be typically toxic, persistent and prone to\nbioaccumulation. Commonly used in building materials and products, these chemicals have a much longer use phase.\nLegacy chemicals, a denomination that includes lead, asbestos, mercury, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are now largely restricted in manufacture and use. However, they continue to pose\ndangers not only in older structures but also through their environmental fate.\n For example, lead exposure\naccounted for an estimate of one million deaths in 2017 and can be considered as a global health priority, even in\nplaces where it is regulated.\n Another example of a legacy contaminant is CCA, a biocide formerly used in outdoor\nwood structures that can leach arsenic and preservative components into the soil where children can be exposed.\nThe WELL Materials concept requires projects to assess the presence of these compounds and take measures to\nprevent human exposure along with restricting them in new products. In addition, testing, remediation and\nredevelopment of sites contaminated with these and many other toxic pollutants is encouraged, in order to support\nenvironmentally responsible growth and preventing sprawl.\nBeyond legacy compounds, other classes of chemicals, such as perfluorinated alkyl compounds (PFCs),\northophthalates, some heavy metals and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), are often used in products because of\ntheir superior performance. However, the health and environmental impacts of many of the compounds in these\nclasses are proven or considered to be deleterious, plus some of them are widely distributed throughout natural\nenvironments and as human metabolites.\n The Materials concept promotes a precautionary approach, favoring\nsubstitutions of certain materials where replacements are available and do not pose sources of exposure for other\nchemicals of unknown or increased toxicity.\nChemicals may not be added to but also emitted from products. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) comprise a large\ngroup of chemicals abundant in indoor environments due to various source materials, including insulation, paints,\ncoatings, adhesives, furniture and furnishings, composite wood products and flooring materials,  and may\nsignificantly affect respiratory health and even increase cancer risks.  As this is particularly important for indoor air\nquality (IAQ) and health, the WELL Materials concept encourages the use of products tested for low VOC emissions.\nThe WELL Materials concept advances two strategies for selecting building materials and products. One is to increase\nliteracy on materials by promoting ingredient disclosure, whereas the second is to promote the assessment and\noptimization of product composition in order to minimize impacts to human and environmental health. Both\nstrategies aim to bridge data gaps in the supply chain, supporting innovation in green chemistry and advancing\nmarket transformation towards healthier and more sustainable products.\n \nFinally, and because potentially hazardous products are introduced into buildings during their day-to-day operations,\nthe WELL Materials concept promotes the use of low-hazard cleaning products and cleaning practices that reduce\nimpacts in indoor air quality and in the health of those performing these duties.  To further promote mitigation of\nenvironmental contamination and protection of public health, the WELL Materials concept includes guidelines for the\nsafe management of some types of waste.\n Finally, the application of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)\nprinciples\n and the use of low-hazard pesticides, along with signage and notice of application, further works to\nprotect health. \n \nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Materials Concept. Note: Material from the research digests is not covered on the WELL AP exam.\nREFERENCES\n1. Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry.

Disease caused by\nexposure to these chemicals, including asbestosis, developmental issues in children  and various forms of cancer still affect millions of people.  While these compounds have been\nrestricted or banned in buildings in many countries, they still pose threats in countries that have not enacted the necessary limitations. As a result, exposure to these hazardous materials\nshould be limited and, if possible, eliminated.\nSolutions : Asbestos has been fully or partially banned for buildings in most countries and alternatives are widely available. Lead content in materials that may expose humans to its\naspiration and ingestion is also restricted in many national regulations.  Use of products where lead content is minimized or not added can significantly reduce leaching from pipes into\ndrinking water. Eliminating the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) removes a potential pathway for exposure to mercury.\nPART 1 RESTRICT ASBESTOS\nFor All Spaces:\nFor newly installed or applied products within the project boundary, the following requirement is met:\na. The following product categories do not contain over 1,000 ppm of asbestos by weight or area:\n1.

{"feature": "X02", "page_start": 167, "page_end": 169, "content": "X02 INTERIOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT | P\nIntent : Manage risks of human exposure to hazardous materials ubiquitously used in past construction practices.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires the application of practices to manage exposure risks of the hazardous building materials asbestos, lead and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).\nIssue : Some materials that were commonly used in construction due to their mechanical, chemical or visual properties have shown to be toxic, and are now banned or confined to\nlimited production across the world. However, their ubiquitous presence still haunts our built and natural environments and can cause disease upon exposure. Asbestos, lead and\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)-containing materials are emblematic examples. Asbestos, a naturally present, chemically resistant material found in old adhesives, insulation and\nsheeting is a known toxicant and carcinogen. Exposure to asbestos-containing dusts is the main cause of mesothelioma and responsible for over 200,000 deaths annually. Lead is found\nin paints for increasing their durability and impermeability. If ingested, absorbed or breathed-in, it accumulates in blood, tissues and bones, potentially disrupting body functions and\nimpairing the intellectual development of children and the unborn during pregnancy. PCBs were used in caulk and electrical equipment, but due to their persistence in the environment,\nbioaccumulation in foods and carcinogenicity, their production is banned worldwide.   \nSolutions : Existing buildings must be evaluated for the presence of hazardous materials and consider their removal when technically feasible. If not possible, hazards must be isolated\nand periodically monitored to prevent human exposure. Generating dust that can become suspended and respirable must be avoided. Any waste generated from construction, or any\nother onsite activity must be handled appropriately in accordance with best practices.   \nPART 1 MANAGE ASBESTOS HAZARDS\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Asbestos risk assessment and remediation\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The building was constructed or last renovated before the enactment of laws banning the installation of asbestos-\ncontaining materials, or is located where there is no local asbestos phase-out regulation.\nb. An inspector certified under local regulation or a qualified professional with demonstrable experience where no\nlocal regulations apply conducts an investigation of the project space and reports the following:\n1. A list of locations where presumed asbestos containing materials (PACM) were found.\n2. Confirmation of the presence of asbestos is performed through Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM), Scanning\nElectron Microscopy (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) testing. The sample number and\nlocation follow applicable laws or recommendations of the inspector conducting the assessment. Materials\nhaving over 1% of asbestos are considered ACM. If analytical confirmation is not available or possible, all PACM\nare considered asbestos-containing materials (ACM).\nc. If asbestos-containing materials (ACM) were found per the above, an action plan that contains the following is\nimplemented: \n1. Notification of any works to relevant authorities and persons living, working or transiting in the vicinity of the\nbuilding or space. \n2. Preventative measures against the formation and spread of asbestos fibers in the air during remedial work.\n3. Measures taken for workers’ protection during remediation activities, including but not limited to skin and\nrespiratory protection. \n4. If ACM are being removed, activities are carried out for proper handling of ACM waste, including: wetting of all\nremoved ACM, care in transportation to prevent crumbling, sealing and leak-tight transportation, proper\nlabeling and final disposal in locations allowed by applicable laws and permits. \n5. Post-remediation clearance for occupancy confirmation by testing of fibers in air using phase contrast\nmicroscopy (PCM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following standards referenced in applicable\nlocal laws or, if not available, NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (MNAM) Methods 7400 or 7402,\nGBZ/T192.5-2007, ISO 8672:2014, ISO 10312:2019 or ISO 13794:2019. The number of samples and sampling\nconditions must meet local regulations and/or conform to ISO 16000-7. \n6. If any of the asbestos is managed by methods other than removal, the month and year of follow-up inspection\nto evaluate the structural integrity of the ACM must be stated and cannot exceed three years from the date of\nthe last inspection.\nOption 2: New spaces\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The building was constructed after the enactment of an asbestos ban in construction products.\nOption 3: Demonstration of prior remediation\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The project was last renovated after the enactment of local laws banning the installation of asbestos-containing\nmaterials.\nb. The project demonstrates that asbestos remediation and clearance is a legal requirement to grant occupancy of\n1 \n2 \n3\nOR\nOR\nPage 166 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nthe space.\nPART 2 MANAGE LEAD PAINT HAZARDS\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Identify lead paint hazards\nThe following requirements are met:\na. A certified inspector or a qualified professional where no local regulations apply conducts an investigation of the\nspace and reports the following: \n1. An inventory of locations of potential sources and sinks of lead-containing materials, where lead-containing\npaint may be present.\n2. Confirmation of lead hazards through in-situ test results by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) or by laboratory analyses\nof paint chips  and/or surface dusts. Surface dust is considered a hazard if its lead loading is more than {{well-\nunit}}10 µg/ft |0.11 mg/m {{/well-unit}} of the collection area if sampled from floors or over {{well-unit}}100\nµg/ft |1.08 mg/m {{/well-unit}} for dust on interior window sills.  Paints having over 0.5% of lead by weight or\n{{well-unit}}930 µg/ft |10,000 mg/m {{/well-unit}} of applied area and bare soil containing over 400 ppm of\nlead by weight are also considered lead hazards.  Lower thresholds mandated by local regulations prevail for\nterms of hazard assessment.\nb. If lead is found in the investigation, a certified inspector (or a qualified professional where no local regulations\napply) implements an action plan that contains the following:\n1. Notification of remediation work to occupants and transient populations in the surrounding spaces, and\nrestriction of access to work areas during remediation.\n2. If paints are mechanically removed, measures are taken to minimize the formation and spread of dusts during\nthe remediation process and to ensure adequate respiratory and skin protection for workers.\n3. A re-inspection schedule that includes visual assessments and dust testing, if any lead-containing paints are\nleft in place and are subject to stabilization (i.e., painted over with products to prevent chipping or\ndegradation) or enclosure, at least once every three years.\n4. Post-remediation clearance, confirming that the lead loading in dust is below the levels deemed hazardous.\nOption 2: New spaces\nThe following requirement is met:\na. The building was constructed after the enactment of lead paint ban.\nOption 3: Demonstration of prior remediation\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The project was last renovated after the enactment of local laws banning the application of lead-containing paint.\nb. The project demonstrates through legal documentation (e.g., approved certificates of occupancy, remediation\nreports submitted to relevant authorities) that lead remediation was performance and clearance was provided.\nPART 3 MANAGE POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL (PCB) HAZARDS\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: PCB remediation\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The building was constructed or last renovated before the institution of any applicable laws banning or restricting\nPCBs, and is undergoing renovation work that disturbs (i.e., partially or fully removes) materials likely to contain\nPCBs such as caulking, fluorescent light ballasts and capacitors of appliances fabricated before 1980.\nb. An inspection strategy for assessing PCB-related risks is implemented and contains the following:\n1. Determination of locations where materials potentially containing PCBs may be disturbed. \n2. If caulk is to be disturbed or removed, analysis of the presumably PCB-containing material following protocols\nmandated by local laws or, in absence of local laws, by any applicable US EPA  or ISO testing methods. \nc. If PCBs are found in disturbed materials, an action plan is implemented and contains the following:\n1. Notification of remedial work to relevant authorities and building occupants.\n2. Preventative measures against the spread of PCB-containing dusts and human exposure during remediation\nactivities, including restricting access for those not involved in the work.\n3. Protective measures for workers, including chemical-resistant gloves, clothing protection, goggles and\nrespirators.\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n5\n2\n2\n5\nOR\nOR\n6\nPage 167 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n4. Waste handling that minimizes the spread of contaminated debris and safe disposal of PCB-containing waste\nin locations allowed by applicable local regulations.\nOption 2: No PCB remediation\nOne of the following is met:\na. The building was constructed or last renovated before the institution of any applicable laws banning or restricting\nPCBs, and the project is not undergoing renovation work that disturbs (i.e., partially or fully removes) materials\nlikely to contain PCBs such as caulking, fluorescent light ballasts and capacitors of appliances fabricated before\n1980.\nb. The building was constructed or last renovated after the institution of any applicable laws banning or restricting\nPCBs.\nREFERENCES\n1. Furuya S, Chimed-Ochir O, Takahashi K, David A, Takala J.

{"feature": "X03", "page_start": 170, "page_end": 171, "content": "X03 CCA AND LEAD MANAGEMENT | P\nIntent : Mitigate risks of human exposure to chromate copper arsenate (CCA) and lead.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires addressing risks associated with human exposure to chromate copper arsenate (CCA) in existing wood structures and lead in soil, playground\nequipment and artificial turf.\nIssue : In the 2000s, the application of CCA (or ‘pressure-treated wood’) was restricted due to health concerns connecting its presence to arsenic exposure to humans, animals and food\ncrops, and  exposure to arsenic is known to cause increased risk of skin, liver, bladder and lung cancers.  However, prior to its restriction, CCA was a widely used wood treatment for\ndecades. As a result, CCA presence in our environment still poses as a threat to our health. Additionally, chromates which are catalogued as carcinogenic to humans  can be inhaled if\nCCA-containing wood is ever burnt. Among other existing external hazards is lead, which may be present in paints used on outdoor structures and playgrounds.  Lead may also\ncontaminate soils upon chipping, in fibers of artificial turf  and in some loose rubber.\nSolutions : Identifying and remediating hazards associated with CCA and lead should reduce risk of exposure to and dispersion of contaminants in the environment through leachates.\nAlthough not all routes of exposure and bioavailability of lead are fully understood,  ingestion and inhalation of lead-containing particles may occur due to contaminated paint or rubber\ncrumbs and, thus, from a precautionary standpoint, testing for lead is recommended.\nPART 1 MANAGE EXTERIOR CCA HAZARDS\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: CCA assessment and remediation\nFor all existing wood structures installed before the enactment of laws banning chromated copper arsenate (CCA)\nwhich lie outside the building envelope but within the project boundary where human presence is expected (e.g.,\nwooden decks, fences near walkways, playgrounds and outdoor furniture), the following requirements are met: \na. Identify CCA-containing wood through one of the following:\n1. Inspection of purchase records.\n2. Determination of whether legal bans for CCA apply.\n3. Testing for the presence of arsenic in the wood or the soil bearing the wooden structures. \nb. Address CCA-containing woods through one of the following:\n1. Dispose of CCA-containing woods following applicable laws, without incinerating nor wood chipping.\n2. Treatment with penetrating (non-film-forming), oil-based, semi-transparent stains that prevent arsenic\nleaching on a regular basis as recommended by the manufacturer. \nOption 2: CCA assessment not required\nOne of the following is met:\na. All existing wood structures that lie outside the building envelope but within the project boundary where human\npresence is expected (e.g., wooden decks, fences near walkways, playgrounds and outdoor furniture) were\ninstalled after the enactment of laws banning chromated copper arsenate (CCA).\nb. The project does not have wood structures that lie outside the building envelope but within the project boundary.\nc. The project does not have spaces outside the building envelope but within the project boundary.\nPART 2 MANAGE LEAD HAZARDS\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Lead assessment\nThe project addresses lead hazards through the following:\na. The top {{well-unit}}0.6 in|1.5 cm{{/well-unit}} layer in all existing outdoor bare soil (outside the building envelope,\npost-construction, not covered by grass, vegetation or other landscaping including mulch covered soil) is tested\nfor lead. Each continuous area of bare soil is sampled at least once. If the lead concentration of any sample\nsurpasses 400 ppm by weight,  then the following is performed:\n1. A second set of samples is taken at {{well-unit}}6 in|15 cm{{/well-unit}}, {{well-unit}}12 in|30 cm{{/well-unit}},\n{{well-unit}}18 in|45 cm{{/well-unit}} and {{well-unit}}24 in|60 cm{{/well-unit}} deep.  \n2. If these samples are above 400 ppm by weight, soil is replaced with soil from another source to the extent of\nthe deepest sample found above this threshold. \nb. Lead in existing artificial turf fibers is assessed as follows:  \n1. If lead concentration of synthetic turf fibers is unknown, test a sample of fibers to determine the lead\nconcentration using an EPA, ISO or locally accepted protocol.\n2. If the total lead concentration of synthetic turf fibers is greater than {{well-unit}}136 mg/lb|300 mg/kg{{/well-\nunit}}, perform dust-wipe testing per EPA, ISO or locally accepted protocol for dust-wipe testing to determine\nthe surface dust-lead loading.\n3. If the wipe-testing results show total lead loadings greater than {{well-unit}}40 µg/ft |430 µg/m {{/well-unit}},\nreplace with turf containing lead concentrations less than {{well-unit}}136 mg/lb|300 mg/kg{{/well-unit}}. \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n6\n7\nOR\n8\n9\n5\n2\n2\nPage 169 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nc. If existing loose-fill rubber from recycled tires is present on playgrounds, sporting fields, or other surfaces, the\nsurface is assessed and remediated per the following:\n1. Sample the loose-fill rubber using an EPA, ISO or locally accepted protocol for lead testing and perform lead\ncontent analysis.\n2. If the loose rubber results show total lead loadings greater than {{well-unit}}136 mg/lb|300 mg/kg{{/well-\nunit}} of rubber, replace the loose-fill rubber. \nd. Paint applied to existing playground equipment, installed and painted before the enactment of banning laws, is\nassessed for lead and removed, as necessary, per the guidance below:\n1. Assess the integrity and age of the paint. If the paint is cracked, peeled or chipped collect a sample for\nlaboratory analysis for lead. Follow guidelines and methods described by the World Health Organization\n or\nlocal equivalents for sampling and laboratory analysis.\n2. Remove or encapsulate the paint from the playground equipment if the sample contains lead at a\nconcentration over 90 ppm. Removal duties must be performed by a certified specialist or someone with\ndemonstrable experience where no local regulations apply.  \ne. Newly installed bare soil, artificial turf fibers and rubber fills are certified by the manufacturer or by a third party to\nnot contain lead above the remediation thresholds stated above. \nOption 2: Lead assessment not applicable\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The project does not have existing post-construction outdoor bare soil (e.g., not covered by grass, vegetation or\nmulch).\nb. The project does not have artificial turf.\nc. The project does not have loose-fill rubber from recycled tires.\nd. Paint applied to existing playground equipment was installed and painted after the enactment of banning laws, or\nno playground equipment is present.\nREFERENCES\n1.

When left unmanaged, contaminants from such sites can pose risks to those who live and work\nnearby through inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact.  Contamination in these sites, which are known as brownfields, may complicate development if not properly addressed.\nSolutions : Site assessment and remediation can reduce risk of exposure to populations that live in proximity to contaminated sites. Cleanup of contaminated sites that can present\nenvironmental (e.g. air, water, soil) and human health hazards helps protect the public from associated hazards and encourages environmentally responsible growth,  further preserving\nundeveloped land.\nPART 1 ASSESS AND MITIGATE SITE HAZARDS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na. Site was used for or affected by past or present industrial activities (e.g., hazardous waste storage, fuel station,\nmanufacturing plant, on-site dry cleaners, automotive repair or brownfields).\nb. Site is assessed for potential contamination in soil or underground water from past uses or surrounding conditions\nusing one of the following:\n1. Local applicable regulation for environmental site assessments.\n2. Guidelines provided in the standard ASTM E1527-05 (Phase I site assessments).  \nc. If the site investigation establishes the potential presence of contaminants, the project implements a sampling\nstrategy to quantify contamination and determine remediation needs according to local regulations or ASTM\nE1903-97 (Phase II site assessment) guidelines.\nd. If remediation is required, the project implements a sustainable remediation plan before, during and after\nconstruction that integrates the following:\n1. A risk-based approach to sustainable remediation (risk assessment/risk-benefit analysis).\n2. A tiered approach to assessment and an appraisal of remediation options.\n3. Safe working practices for workers during remediation.\n4. Record keeping of decision-making and assessment processes.\n5.

However, some newly introduced chemicals that pose to be advantageous\nfrom a performance or cost perspective, may be associated with negative health effects. Populations that prove to be the most vulnerable to these chemicals are unborn and young\nchildren, as well as pregnant women.\n Chemical classes with compounds suspected or proven to pose health concerns include orthophthalates (common plasticizers), halogenated\nflame retardants (HFR)\n and other per-fluorinated compounds (PFCs) and heavy metals, in addition to formaldehyde.  Common pathways of exposure to these compounds are through\ninhalation, skin contact or swallowing of dusts, soils or larger particles. Overall, there is a great research gap in assessing the safety of these and many other chemicals,  driven both by\ntheir ubiquity in the environment, as well as their presence in the human body. For instance, Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and\nperfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are persisting PFCs in natural environments (including sources of drinking water) and found in humans. Metabolites of orthophthalates are partially\nmetabolized by the body and commonly found in urine.\nSolutions : Selecting products that are devoid of or have reduced amount of chemicals associated with health concerns may help to prevent exposure to these compounds. Some\norganizations have published regulations, guidelines or certifications that restrict or minimize the presence of certain chemicals from these classes.\nPART 1 SELECT COMPLIANT INTERIOR FURNISHINGS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Furniture, millwork and fixtures\nAt least 50% by cost of newly installed furniture, millwork and fixtures (minimum 10 distinct products), as defined in\nAppendix X1, meet one of the following requirements:\na.

Furthermore, some select VOCs are known or suspected carcinogens.  While these compounds are present outside,\nbuildings are a net source due to human activities, cleaning practices and emissions from materials.  Newly installed furniture, insulation, flooring as well as wet-applied products such as\npaints, adhesives, sealants and coatings can significantly introduce VOCs into living spaces  for approximately one to two years,  and sometimes causing elevated concentrations in\nenclosed spaces like wardrobes.   These compounds can react in many ways to form new compounds and respirable particles, even seemingly impacting air pollution outdoors.\nSolutions : The selection of products with low or no VOC emissions is instrumental to prevent worsening in air quality. When VOCs are emitted, careful material selection in newly built\nspaces has been shown to accelerate VOCs reduction (i.e. off-gassing) to background levels.  Reducing level of toxic compound emission will also help to reduce the demands of\nventilation.  Off-gassed products (e.g., reused furniture) also limit further emissions. \nPART 1 LIMIT VOCS FROM WET-APPLIED PRODUCTS (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nNewly installed interior wet-applied paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants (minimum 10 distinct products or applied\nto at least 10% of project area) meet the following:\na.

As a result, there is\na lack of robust data and knowledge about different chemicals and their effects on human health.  Such limitations in awareness prevents the adoption and use of chemicals believed to\nbe safer in the industry.  Additionally, building and construction materials are not required to have complete ingredient lists, which makes it difficult to make fully informed choices when\nselecting safer products.\nSolutions : Growing scientific and public concern over chemical exposure has prompted the introduction of a number of disclosure tools to help differentiate safer ingredients and\nproducts. Labels that promote material ingredient disclosure encourage supply chain transparency and work to bridge the information gap between manufacturers and users. Further,\npromoting awareness of and education on material ingredient content through product labeling can help enable informed decision making.\nPART 1 SELECT PRODUCTS WITH DISCLOSED INGREDIENTS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFor at least 25 distinct, permanently installed products (including flooring, insulation, wet-applied products, lighting\nfixtures, ceilings, and wall assemblies and systems), furniture and task and floor lamps, ingredients are disclosed by the\nmanufacturer, a disclosure organization or a third party through one of the following:\na.

For instance, unmanaged products containing mercury and other heavy metals may expose people to elevated toxic metals through soil, air and water.\n Leftover\npesticides that have become obsolete or otherwise unusable may be disposed in general-purpose dumps, and improper disposal can result in physical injury, environmental pollution\nand land degradation.  Finally, electronic waste, if not properly handled, may create significant health effects downstream.   \nSolutions : A protocol for handling and minimizing hazardous wastes, which involves separation of hazardous from other solid wastes and procuring adequate receptors for recycling or\nfinal disposal, can help mitigate chemical pollution and associated health concerns. By raising awareness and properly managing hazardous wastes, as well as by selecting products that\nare easier to reuse and have a lower impact on human health, projects may minimize the generation of such wastes and the release of hazardous materials into the environment. \nPART 1 IMPLEMENT A WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFor all batteries, pesticides, lamps that may contain mercury, other mercury-containing equipment (including\nthermostats and thermometers),  and electrical and electronic equipment  present or expected to be present within\nthe project during the building operations, a waste management plan that contains the following is developed and\nimplemented:\na.

While pesticides are tailored to address many\nproblematic weeds, fungi, insects and rodents, exposure to specific pesticides may present danger to human health. For instance, studies have shown increased likelihood of cancer in\nchildren  and breast cancer , as well as birth defects upon maternal exposure to certain compounds.\nSolutions : Biological or chemical pesticides should only be used when absolutely necessary. Pesticide use, and associated risks, can be reduced through the application of IPM , which\ninvolves a decision-making process for the identification of pests, an understanding of the triggers that drive infestation, and the establishment of cultural, physical and educational\nbarriers against their ingress.\n When pesticides are needed, those deemed more protective of human health are preferred along with signage detailing pesticide information at the site\nof application providing further safeguard.\nPART 1 MANAGE PESTS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Pest management development and implementation\nA management plan for pest control based on integrated pest management (IPM) principles  is implemented for all\nindoor and outdoor spaces, addressing the following:\na. Plan contains the following elements:\n1. List of roles and responsibilities for the program development, implementation, maintenance and education.\n2. Pest management objectives, including protocols for identification of pests and metrics of progress.\n3. Design and operational measures to prevent conditions that may attract pests (e.g., access to food, water,\nharborage and entrance through the building envelope).\n4. Pest tolerance thresholds and control strategies (including methods and response times) for when tolerance\nthresholds are exceeded, attending to the safety of the applicator, the occupants and the environment.\n5. Records of pest monitoring data, pest events, pesticide applications, control actions and emergency\nresponses.  \nb. Each pesticide used for periodic (i.e., non-emergency) application is listed in the plan and meets one of the\nfollowing:\n1. Evaluated through the City of San Francisco Pesticide Hazard Screening Protocol with a Hazard Tier ranking of\n3 (least hazardous).\n2. Listed in the most recent version of the City of San Francisco's Reduced Risk Pesticide List as directed in the list\n(including limitations).\n3. All active substances catalogued as ‘low-risk’ in the EU Pesticides Database.\n4. All active substances are marked as “Approved” in the EU Pesticides Database  and are either classified as\nClass U or not classified in the latest version of “The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by\nHazard and Guidelines to Classification.”   \nc. For pesticide application (periodic or emergency) within the project, the plan includes the following provisions:\n1. Paper or digital notification to all building occupants on the protocol for pesticide use.\n2. Notification to all building occupants at least 24-hours prior to pesticide application, and signage posted at the\nsite of application at least 24-hours prior to application until at least 24 hours after application.\n3. Notifications include the pesticide name, registration number, treatment location and date of application and\napplicator. If emergency pesticide application is needed, information on the type of emergency or reason for\nunplanned use. \nd. The effectiveness of the plan is evaluated on an annual basis.\ne.

Microorganisms such as house dust mites –ubiquitously present around the world– are directly related with\nasthma  and allergy  development. Surfaces may host pathogens present in feces and body fluids released by sick individuals, or through contact with another contaminated surface.\nBeyond naturally-accumulating dust, commercial cleaning products may contain ingredients that may also degrade the indoor air quality and are suspected to be hazardous to human\nhealth.  Some products may emit substances that irritate the nose, eyes, throat and lungs and can cause or trigger asthma attacks.  Moreover, the interactions between cleaning agents,\nmicrobes and public health are diverse and complex\n, and we are just beginning to better understand them.    Cleaning practices may cause additional health concerns. For instance,\nindiscriminate use of cleaning sprays is suspected to be a risk factor for adult asthma.  Similarly, lack of education on the use of gloves during wet cleaning activities may explain the high\nprevalence of hand dermatitis in the cleaning service industry.\nSolutions : A thorough plan for cleaning operations that considers the health of occupants and cleaning staff increases the overall efficiency of the process, while reducing\nenvironmental damage.  The plan must align with advise from public health agencies for disinfection requirements.\n Along personal protective equipment (PPE), the implementation of\nengineering controls (e.g., ventilation) and policies is key to reduce exposure to hazards during cleaning practices.  The provision of cleaning products that contain less hazardous\ningredients may reduce the risk of respiratory and dermal symptoms.  \nPART 1 IMPROVE CLEANING PRACTICES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nOption 1: Cleaning plan development and implementation\nThe project develops and implements a cleaning plan that meets the following requirements:\na.

Cleaning supplies and where they can be accessed.\n4. Process to evaluate and document adherence to the cleaning plan.\n \nb. Identifies the following:\n1. Surfaces that require disinfection (e.g., high-touch surfaces).\n2. Frequency and/or other thresholds (e.g., number of hours, number users of a space, results from a swab test)\nfor disinfection. \n3. Applicable governmental registration and directions of use (e.g., contact time and dilution rates) for\ndisinfectants.\n4. Other non-chemical tools used for disinfection, if any.\nc. States the following documentation procedures:\n1. Record keeping practices for cleaning and disinfection activities.\n2. The chain of communications with building occupants.\n3. A system to log feedback from occupants and cleaning staff. \nd. Specifies the following for cleaning materials and personal protection equipment (PPE):\n1. PPE requirements for general cleaning and specialized tasks (e.g., disinfection or dilution or chemicals). \n2. Color-coding for reusable and disposable cleaning cloths.\n3.

Factors that may affect exposure include the size distribution of the respiratory particles,  humidity,\n air flow\n and air treatment.\n While the relative influence of these\nfactors is variable, direct exposure to particles shed by an infected individual may increase a person’s odds of acquiring certain diseases.\n   Respiratory and fecal particles can reach\nsurfaces either by direct deposition from the source (e.g., coughing on a surface) or indirectly through hands. On inanimate contaminated surfaces (called fomites), pathogens may\nsurvive for a number of hours or even days.\n Pathogens may spread from these surfaces when touched, potentially infecting people through oral or nasal exposure.\n Fomites have been\nlinked to disease transmission for many common viral pathogens, including rotaviruses – the most common cause of children’s diarrhea in the world – and adenoviruses, and have been\nassociated with some strains of coronaviruses.\nSolutions : Implementing design and policy strategies aimed at reducing exposure to some particles shed by infected individuals, like establishing physical distancing among people\nor providing physical barriers to prevent respiratory particles from spreading,\n may slow the spread of pathogens.\n Reimagining spaces to reduce the number of surfaces a person needs\nto touch, as well as implementing enhanced hygiene protocols for high-touch surfaces, may reduce the risk of pathogen transmission.\nPART 1 Β REDUCE RESPIRATORY PARTICLE EXPOSURE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\n1: Contact reduction cues\nThe following requirements are implemented during periods when higher incidence of respiratory disease is likely:\na.

Products used in the\nconstruction of real estate are significant contributors to this problem.  Due to the complexity and obscurity of supply chains, it can be nearly impossible to identify products and\nmaterials that are “slavery-free.”\nImpact : Creating demand for “slavery-free” products, in addition to aiding in the  elimination of forced labor and the worst forms of child labor, can steer the market towards making fair\nlabor practices the baseline across the building products industry.  As one of the main contributors of decent work,  provision of a living wage is likely to improve workers’ physical and\nmental health and has the potential of breaking the poverty cycle.  Going deeper into the supply chain, several certification bodies assess and certify good labor practices during the\nextraction and processing of common raw building materials such as cement, steel and copper.  Finally, companies can assess labor conditions within their own facilities and across their\nown supply chains through third-party audits and/or the achievement of relevant certifications. \nPART 1 SELECT PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS THAT PROVIDE LIVING WAGES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFor at least five manufacturers of products from the product classes listed in Appendix X1, one the following is\nprovided:\na. Manufacturer’s proof of accreditation provided by one of the following organizations:\n1. SAI (Social Accountability International) Reference, administered by Social Accountability Accreditation\nServices (SAAS).\n2. Any certification from the Reference.\n3. A living wage certification from a member of the Reference.\nb. Manufacturer’s public statement disclosing the living wage provision that includes the following:\n1. How a living wage is provided to all people (including contractors) who work in the manufacturer’s facilities.\n2. How the living wage is determined and regularly updated. \n3. How organization-wide compliance with the living wage provision is confirmed, including metrics used to\nmeasure compliance.\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The\nfeedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that are effective and applicable to projects around the\nworld.\nPART 2 SELECT PRODUCTS WITH CERTIFIED RAW MATERIALS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFor at least ten products from the product classes listed in Appendix X1, each made by a distinct manufacturer, one of\nthe following is met:\na. Has one of the following:\n1. A Reference with a Silver, Gold or Platinum Social Fairness level.\n2. Any Reference that includes criteria for “Minimum Entitlement including Wages,” “Workplace Health and\nSafety,” and “Modern Slavery and Human Rights including Labor Rights”.\n3. A Reference.\nb. For products containing materials listed in Appendix X2, each of those materials (up to a maximum of five materials\nper product) meet one of the following:\n1. Is certified under one of the applicable standards listed in Appendix X2.\n2. Is supplied by a manufacturer that meets Part 1 of this feature.\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The\nfeedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that are effective and applicable to projects around the\nworld.\nPART 3 SELECT MANUFACTURERS WITH TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFor at least five manufacturers of products from the product lasses listed in Appendix X1, one of the following is met:\na. The manufacturer is a Full Member of the Reference.\nb. The manufacturer has made a public statement disclosing the following:\n1\n2\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nPage 188 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n1. Confirmation that at least five of the manufacturer’s suppliers (or 5%, whichever is greater) have been assessed\nfor labor conditions by third-party auditors.\n2. Confirmation that the audits were based on semi-announced visits to the manufacturer’s supplier facilities.\n3. The audit criteria, sampling methodology and relevant metrics of compliance.\n4. Confirmation that the facilities were found in compliance with local regulation and the following principles:\n1. Workers’ freedom of movement.\n2. Workers’ freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n3. Forced labor.\n4. Working hours and remuneration.\n5. Occupational health and safety.\n6. Worst forms of child labor.\n7. Sexual harassment.\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form).

Mental health is not simply the absence of a mental\nhealth condition.  Rather, it is a state of well-being, in which individuals are able to live to their fullest potential, cope\nwith the normal stresses of life, work productively and contribute to their community.  Mental health is determined by\na range of socioeconomic, biological and environmental factors, such as work conditions, lifestyle and health\nbehaviors.  Through a variety of interventions, the WELL Mind concept seeks to address and support these drivers of\nmental health with the goal of improving the cognitive and emotional health and well-being of those living, working,\nlearning and spending time in built spaces.\nMental health and substance use conditions are a widespread global health concern. They collectively account for\n13% of the global burden of disease and an estimated 32% of years lived with disability.  Alcohol and drug use\ncontribute significantly to the global burden of premature death and disability, with alcohol alone accounting for 3.3\nmillion deaths per year (or 6% of all deaths) and 5% of the global burden of disease.  Depression and anxiety disorders\nare among the leading causes of global burden of disease, ranking first and sixth, respectively.  Depression alone\naccounts for 4% of the global burden of disease and is considered to be among the largest causes of disability\nworldwide. Overall, it is estimated that 14.3% of deaths worldwide (approximately eight million people per year) are\nattributable to mental health conditions.    \nAn estimated 18% of adults will experience a common mental health condition, such as anxiety, depression or\nsubstance abuse, over a 12-month period, and over 30% of adults will experience a mental health condition during \ntheir lifetime. Approximately two-thirds of individuals experiencing common mental health conditions are employed.\nThe impact of mental health in the workplace is profound, with depression and anxiety alone costing the global\neconomy an estimated $1 trillion due to lost productivity.\nDespite its enormous global impact, worldwide spending on mental health is less than $2 per person.  Although\ntreatments for these conditions exist, they are often unavailable or vastly underutilized. In high-income countries, 35–\n50% of people living with mental health conditions receive no care or treatment.  This gap widens in low- and middle-\nincome countries, where 76–85% of people living with mental health conditions do not receive necessary treatment.\nIf left unmanaged, mental health conditions – especially depression – can place an individual at risk for suicidal\nthoughts, attempted suicide and completed suicide. Suicide results in a tragic and preventable death, accounting for\nmore than 800,000 deaths per year worldwide.\nIt is increasingly recognized that a complex relationship exists between the mind and the body and that this interplay\ncan significantly impact health and well-being. Mental and physical health impact each other across some of the most\ncommon chronic diseases, including HIV, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  Furthermore, states of chronic stress\nare associated with increased risk of numerous adverse health consequences, such as depression, cardiovascular\ndisease, diabetes and upper respiratory infection.  Depression alone is associated with an increased risk of disease,\nincluding diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma.  Due to the numerous ways in which mental health\nimpacts physical health, people with mental health conditions experience a mortality rate 2.2 times higher than the\ngeneral population and a median of 10 years of potential life lost.\nThe built environment serves as a powerful tool to help mitigate these adverse mental health outcomes through\npolicies, programs and design. Given the high prevalence of mental health conditions among the working population,\nthe workplace is increasingly being seen as an important target for mental health promotion, prevention and\ninterventions.\n Organizations can promote mental health through a variety of strategies. These include improving\nmental health literacy and reducing stigma; providing healthy living and working conditions for all—such as fostering\npositive work environments and offering stress management programs; and supporting the availability and use of\nmental health, substance use, and addiction services and treatment.\nImproving opportunities for restoration\nthrough mindfulness programming, restorative spaces and support of optimal sleep can also have a marked impact on\nphysical and mental well-being, including relief from negative symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, pain\nand stress, as well as enhancements in overall perceived health.\n Lastly, design strategies, such as increasing nature\ncontact within built spaces, has been linked with numerous health promoting benefits, including decreased levels of\ndepression and anxiety, increased attentional capacity, better recovery from job stress and illness, increased pain\ntolerance and increased psychological well-being.\nThe WELL Mind concept promotes implementation of design, policy and programmatic strategies that support\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n8\n1\n1\n3\n2\n1\n1\n6\n10\n5,11 \n12,13\n14–16\nPage 193 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

In combination, these\ninterventions have the potential to positively impact the short- and long-term mental health and well-being of\nindividuals of all backgrounds throughout a community.\n \nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Mind Concept.

Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world, and depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy an estimated $1 trillion due to lost\nproductivity, yet global annual spending on mental health is less than $2 per person.\n Failure to address mental health in the workplace can contribute to high turnover, presenteeism\nand absenteeism, repetitive recruitment and training costs, increased use of drug plans, disability claims, sick leave, employee assistance plans (EAPs) and other costly supports, increased\naccidents and injuries, and burnout.\n \nSolutions : Given the high prevalence of mental health conditions among the working population, the workplace is an important target for promotion, prevention and intervention\nefforts.\n Strategies include increased organizational support, enhancement of mental health literacy and reduction of stigma, which have been shown to help people recognize signs of\npoor mental health and encourage help-seeking behavior.\nImproving opportunities for restoration through mindfulness programming and optimal sleep can have a marked impact on\nmental well-being, including relief from negative symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, pain and stress, as well as enhancements in overall perceived health.\nPART 1 PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na. At least two of the following are available to all employees and students at no additional cost:\n1. Education or awareness efforts on mental health and well-being, offered quarterly, either in-person or virtually\n(e.g., webcast on stress management, presentation on mindfulness, email on healthy sleep habits).\n2. Trainings or courses related to mental health and well-being, offered annually, either in-person or virtually\n(e.g., Mental Health First Aid, stress management training).\n3. Mindfulness or restorative programming, offered weekly, either in-person or virtually (e.g., ongoing access to\nguided meditation application, weekly yoga classes).\n4. Policy that establishes healthy working hours, outlining the maximum hours to be worked per 24-hour and\nseven-day period.\n5. Dedicated space for restoration and relaxation, with an accompanying policy permitting breaks during work or\nschool hours.\nb. Annual communication (e.g., email, online module, in-person training) is provided to all employees and students,\nand onboarding communications are provided to all new employees and students, specifically addressing all\nmental health and well-being benefits, resources and programs available through the project or organization.\nNote : Projects may achieve points in optimizations that overlap with strategies listed in Part 1.a.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Additionally,\nincorporating other key aesthetic elements, such as local culture, materials and art can help celebrate the project’s unique identity and further enrich the space for occupants and\nvisitors.\nPART 1 PROVIDE CONNECTION TO NATURE\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nThe project integrates the following throughout the space, including common circulation routes, shared seating areas\nand rooms (e.g., conference rooms, common spaces) and workstations (as applicable):\na. Natural materials, patterns, shapes, images or sounds.\nb. At least one of the following: \n1. Plants (e.g., potted plants, plant walls).\n2. Water (e.g., fountain, pond, fish tank).\n3. Nature views.\nPART 2 PROVIDE CONNECTION TO PLACE\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nThe project integrates design elements that address the following:\na. Celebration of culture (e.g., culture of occupants, workplace, surrounding community).\nb. Celebration of place (e.g., local architecture, materials, flora, artists).\nc. Integration of art.\nd. Human delight.\nREFERENCES\n1. Zipperer WC, Pickett ST. Urban Ecology: Patterns of Population Growth and Ecological Effects. eLS. 2012;(2008):1-\n8. doi:10.1002/9780470015902.a0003246.pub2\n2.

It is estimated that 76-85% of people in low- and middle-income countries and 30-50% in\nhigh-income countries receive no treatment, and those who do receive help often face issues with poor quality care.\n Compared to other illnesses, mental health conditions have longer\ndelays in treatment onset.\n Many factors contribute to this gap, including a lack of healthcare coverage between benefits for mental health, substance abuse and addiction, and benefits\nfor other medical needs, as well as insufficient mental health promotion to increase awareness and minimize the stigma associated with mental health conditions.\n This lack of\ntreatment has major public health and economic consequences: individuals with depression miss an average of 4.8 workdays and experience 11.5 days of reduced productivity in a three-\nmonth period, and people living with mental health conditions are overall less likely to receive high quality medical care and preventive health services (e.g., immunizations, cancer\nscreening, tobacco cessation support).\n Furthermore, many individuals who go through emergency situations (e.g., natural disaster) experience psychological distress, resulting in\ndepression, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, irritability or anger.\n These impacts can be exacerbated by added stressors during emergencies such as social isolation, economic\nhardship or grief, reinforcing the need for adequate access to mental health services.\nSolutions : Increasing access to screening and mental health services can help encourage care utilization, support early diagnosis and overall mitigate poor mental health outcomes.\nEnhanced social support and adjustments to the work environment can also help enable a successful return for employees coming back from leave due to a mental health condition.\nAdditionally, providing access to mental health services during and after emergency situations, such as psychological first aid, crisis counseling and bereavement counseling, is critical to\nsupporting employee short-term recovery and long-term productivity, functioning and well-being.\nPART 1 OFFER MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization makes a clinical assessment screening tool (e.g., self-assessment, screening tool\nadministered by a professional) for common mental health conditions available to all employees and students either\nin-person or virtually, at no additional cost. The tool meets the following requirements:\na. Addresses, at minimum, stress, depression, anxiety and substance use.\nb. Provides confidentiality by leveraging a licensed mental health professional, third party organization, online\nscreening or health insurance offering.\nc. Includes directed feedback and/or guidance on interpretation of results and provides next steps for those who\nscreen positive or at-risk.\nPART 2 OFFER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization makes a mental health benefits policy available to all eligible employees that meets\nfollowing requirements:\na.   Mental health support is available at no additional cost or subsidized and covers the following at a minimum:\n1. Clinical screening and referral to licensed mental health professionals and support resources.\n2. Inpatient treatment (e.g., residential programs, hospitalization).\n3. Outpatient treatment, including options for telemental health services (e.g., in-person therapy, online\ntherapy).\n4. Prescription medication.\nb. Mental health parity in health service coverage.\nc. Information on benefits coverage and how to access mental health services and community resources is easily\nand confidentially available (e.g., via a health portal or employee website).\nd. Confidential benefits consultation with people who are clearly identified and qualified (e.g., benefits counselor,\nhuman resources representative) is made available.\nPART 3 OFFER EMPLOYEE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization has a mental health policy and the benefits within are made available to all employees\nwithout a need to disclose the underlying health reason. The mental health policy meets the following requirements:\na. Sick leave may be used for mental health needs (e.g., appointments).\nb. Short- or long-term leave may be used for mental health needs, with the option of a phased integration back to\nwork after returning from leave.\nc. Increased interpersonal support (e.g., manager support with prioritizing and managing workloads, increased\nfrequency of one-on-one check-ins).\nd. Adjustment of work schedule to support mental health needs (e.g., appointments, start/end times).\ne. Adjustment of the workplace to support mental health (e.g., moving a workstation to a busier or a quieter area,\nproviding a quiet space for breaks, providing earplugs or headphones, increasing personal space, providing the\nability to work from home).\nPART 4 Β SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY (MAX : 1 PT )\n12\n3,4\n5,6\n7,8\n9,10\n9,10\n5\n11,12\n9,10,13,14\n6,15\n6\n6\n6,16\n6\n6\n6\n12,17,18\n18,19\n12\n12,17,18\n12,17,18\nPage 199 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

Enhancing knowledge and awareness can help shift perspectives, as\nwell as improve employee mental health via greater and potentially earlier help-seeking.  Education and trainings on stigma have been shown to have a positive impact on participants'\nown general mental health,  as well as their behavior toward those with mental health conditions, such as: enhancing perceived confidence and self-efficacy in identifying and\nsupporting a person with a mental health condition, increased likelihood of advising those in need to seek professional help and greater readiness to provide help in a mental health\nsituation.  A systematic review of Mental Health First Aid training demonstrated increased participants’ knowledge regarding mental health, decreased negative attitudes, increased\nsupportive behavior and confidence in helping others and has been shown to be highly acceptable in a workplace setting.\nPART 1 OFFER MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nTrainings (in the form of education seminars, workshops or classes) are offered at least twice per year or on demand\nto regular occupants and meet the following requirements: \na. Address at least two of the following topics:\n1. Managing personal mental health and well-being, covering topics such as developing mentally healthy habits\nand self-care practices, fostering relationships and social connections and managing mental health at work.\n2. Common mental health conditions or concerns, covering, at minimum, depression, anxiety, substance use,\nstress, and burnout, and loneliness and social isolation.\n3. Signs and symptoms of mental health distress, including how to identify emotional distress and appropriately\nrespond (e.g., Mental Health First Aid).\nb. Provided in-person or virtually (live or recorded), in group or individual settings, and through vendors, on-site\nstaff, health insurance plans, community groups or other qualified programs (e.g., Mental Health First Aid).\nPART 2 OFFER MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION FOR MANAGERS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAll managers undergo annual mental health training (in the form of education seminars, workshops or classes) that\nmeets the following requirements:\na. Addresses at least three of the following topics:\n1. Identifying and reducing workplace stress–related issues (e.g., conducting performance reviews, effective\ncommunication skills, personnel management, conflict resolution).\n2. Recognizing common mental health conditions or concerns, covering, at a minimum, depression, anxiety,\nsubstance use, stress and burnout, and loneliness and social isolation.\n3. Supporting employee mental well-being using strategies to prevent burnout, low motivation, fatigue, poor\nwork-life balance and other work-related stress issues.\n4. Recognizing employee mental health concerns or crises, including increasing awareness of workplace and\ncommunity resources available to employees.\nb. Provided in-person or virtually (live or recorded), in group or individual settings, and through vendors, on-site\nstaff, health insurance plans, community groups or other qualified programs (e.g., Mental Health First Aid).\nREFERENCES\n1.

Employee stress is incredibly common, with recent studies reporting 94% of workers feel stress on the job and 25% report work as their number one\nstressor.\n Stressed employees are more likely to quit, be involved in an accident, experience reduced performance and incur an average of nearly 46% higher health care expenditures\ncompared to less-stressed peers.  Employees who experience stress are more likely to miss work, resulting in an estimated one million worker absences per day due to stress.\nSolutions : Numerous factors increase the likelihood of workplace stress, such as low support from supervisors and colleagues, little control over work processes, unmanageable and\nhigh demands, concern over a lack of job security and low opportunity for advancement or professional development. Stress and its associated risks can be reduced through\ninterventions that adjust job stressors, such as changes in operations, increases in co-worker and supervisor support and training employees in developing resilience to withstand job\nstressors.\n   \nPART 1 DEVELOP STRESS MANAGEMENT PLAN (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization develops a stress management plan by completing the following:\na. Assess at least three of the organization- or project-wide metrics below:\n1. Frequency of employees working more than 48 hours per seven-day period.  \n2. Frequency of absenteeism amongst employees (i.e., use of paid or unpaid time off due to disability or illness).\n3. Frequency of employees not using allocated paid time off.\n4. Frequency of performance issues amongst employees.\n5. Employee retention and turnover rates.\n6. Responses to employee satisfaction surveys that indicate high levels of stress or burnout\nb. Identify opportunities for improvement, covering the topics below:\n1. Organizational change to address employee stress (e.g., adjustments to work environment, shifts in work\nprocesses, workload, management or staffing).\n2. Employee participation in organizational decisions regarding work-related issues that may affect stress (e.g.,\nwork environment, processes, scheduling).\nc. Create and implement a stress management plan that identifies the following:\n1. The person leading implementation of the plan.\n2. The changes that are to be completed as part of the plan.\n3. Who will be impacted by those changes.\n4. When and how the changes will be implemented.\n5. Confirmation of support from executive leadership.\nREFERENCES\n1. Quick J, Henderson D.

Targeted interventions, such as limits on working hours and schedule, can help support individuals in\nachieving sufficient and high-quality sleep.\n Research indicates that regular vacations may have a protective effect against chronic work stress by providing a sustained period of relief\nfrom daily stressors, demands and routines.\n Short afternoon naps also provide an opportunity for restoration during the workday, leading to beneﬁts in mood, alertness and cognitive\nperformance, such as productivity and learning.\nPART 1 SUPPORT HEALTHY WORKING HOURS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization has a policy on schedules and time off that meets the following requirements:\na. For all employees:\n1. A minimum of 11 consecutive hours off from work is available per 24-hour period.\n2. A minimum of 24 consecutive hours off from work is available per 7-day period.\n3. Employees who engage in shift work are provided a minimum 48-hour advance notice of shift changes.\nb. For all eligible employees:\n1. A minimum of 20 days of paid time off per calendar year (not including paid sick days or public holidays).\n2. Work and work-related communications are not required during paid time off.\n3. Sick, vacation, floating holiday, personal and all other employer-provided days off from work are clearly\ndefined.\n4. Accrual policy is defined, including whether rollover days are allowed and date by which rollover days must be\nused.\nc. For students in secondary schools (if applicable), the school day starts no earlier than 8:30 a.m.\nPART 2 PROVIDE NAP POLICY AND SPACE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Nap policy\nThe following requirement is met for all eligible employees:\na. Employees are allowed to engage in at least one nap or rest break of at least 30 minutes during the workday (not\nto be combined with designated time for meal breaks).\n2: Nap space\nThe following requirements are met for all eligible employees:\na.   Access to at least one acoustically and visually separated environment located in a designated quiet zone.\nb. At least one fully reclining furniture option (e.g., bed, daybed, couch, chair, cushioned roll-out mat, nap pod) for\nevery 100 eligible employees.\nNote :\n \nProjects should refer to feature S01 Sound Mapping, Part 1: Label Acoustical Zones for all designated quiet zones.\n \nProjects can utilize one room as a combined nap space (M06) and restorative space (M07). Projects will only receive\npoints for both features, if all requirements for M06 Part 2 and M07 Part 1 have been met. \n \nREFERENCES\n1. Snow DL, Swan SC, Wilton LEO.

The experience of prolonged\nfatigue combined with a high need for mental recovery is strongly associated with psychological distress, including decreased mental acuity, deficits in motivation and irritability caused\nby prolonged exposure to stress.\nSolutions : By providing restorative spaces for individuals to step away from the stress of the office environment, recharge and refocus, employers can help alleviate the negative effects\nassociated with workplace fatigue or mental depletion.  Through incorporation of nature, among other restorative elements, these spaces can help relieve stress and mental fatigue,\nsupport focus and encourage overall mental well-being.  Exposure to plants and other natural elements has been linked with decreased levels of diastolic blood pressure, depression\nand anxiety, increased attentional capacity, better recovery from job stress and increased psychological well-being.\n Nature interaction has also been shown to support recovery from\nillness and increase pain tolerance.\n Outdoor spaces can also be used to promote calm and encourage restorative activities. Both indoor and outdoor spaces can also be used for\nindividuals with a wide variety of beliefs, religions and traditions, including prayer and meditation.\nPART 1 PROVIDE RESTORATIVE SPACE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Restorative space\nThe project provides at least one indoor or outdoor space for all regular occupants. The space may be made up of a\nsingle space or multiple spaces that meet the following requirements:\na. The main purpose is for relaxation and restoration. Space may serve multiple functions but is not to be used for\nwork.\nb. Minimum size of {{well-unit}}75 ft²|7 m²{{/well-unit}} plus {{well-unit}}1 ft²|0.1 m²{{/well-unit}} per regular\noccupant or {{well-unit}}2,000 ft²|186 m²{{/well-unit}} whichever is smaller.\nc. Provides a calming and comfortable environment by incorporating at least five of the following:\n1. Adjustable lighting (e.g., dimmable light levels for indoor spaces).\n2. Sound interventions (e.g., water feature, natural sounds, sound masking).\n3. Thermal control (e.g., fans, shading).\n4. Seating arrangements that accommodate a range of user preferences and activities (e.g., movable lightweight\nchairs, cushions, mats).\n5. Nature or natural elements.\n6. Subdued colors, textures and forms.\n7. Visual privacy.\nd. Includes signage, education materials or other resources explaining its purpose and intended use.\nNote : If restorative space is provided only outdoors, it must be functional year-round.\n2: Workday breaks\nThe project encourages the use of restorative space(s) through the following:\na. Paid breaks away from the workstation for all employees.\nREFERENCES\n1. de Bloom J, Kompier M, Geurts S, de Weerth C, Taris T, Sonnentag S. Do we recover from vacation?

In the European Union, for example, an estimated one in three workers experience work-related stress.  Exposure to stressful work\nconditions is associated with poor mental and physical health.  Highly stressed employees are at risk for numerous negative outcomes, including decreased productivity, greater\nabsenteeism, increased occupational injury and higher overall medical expenditures.\nSolutions : Introducing mindfulness into the workplace has been shown to lower employee stress, as well as improve focus, clarity of thinking, decision-making and emotional\nintelligence.\n Meditation interventions targeting workers have been found to be effective at reducing work-associated stress, depression, anxiety and burnout, as well as improving\nmood and sleep quality.\n A recent systematic review concluded that mindfulness meditation can help reduce negative dimensions of psychological stress, including improving anxiety,\ndepression, pain, stress and overall mental health.\n Mindfulness-based stress reduction, a widely disseminated and frequently used practice, has been shown to reduce symptoms of\nstress, depression and anxiety, and enhance self-esteem, body image, mood and coping with other health problems, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stress and insomnia.\n Mindfulness-\nbased practices, whether formal or informal, can help improve employee focus and productivity, support stress management and reduce employer costs through improvements to\noverall health and well-being.\nPART 1 PROVIDE RESTORATIVE PROGRAMMING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least two of the following are offered to all eligible employees at no cost or subsidized by at least 50%:\na. Mindfulness training course (e.g., eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course (MBSR)) offered live,\neither in-person or virtually, by a qualified mindfulness instructor at least twice a year, that meets the following:\n1. Defines mindfulness and its component parts.\n2. Covers relevant research on mindfulness.\n3. Teaches both formal practices (e.g., mindfulness meditation, yoga postures) and informal practices (e.g.,\nmindful eating, mindful listening) that can be applied during the workday.\nb. Mindfulness programming (e.g., guided meditation, yoga) offered live, either in-person or virtually, at least once a\nweek in a designated quiet zone. \nc. Digital mindfulness offerings (e.g., guided meditation application). Employees have unlimited access to at least one\ndigital offering and access to at least one designated quiet zone. \nNote : Refer to feature S01 Sound Mapping, Part 1: Label Acoustical Zones for all designated quiet zones.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Access to outdoor green spaces is associated with a range of short- and long-term mental health benefits for individuals across the life span, from children\nto older adults.\n The many associated benefits include lower levels of anxiety and depression, as well as improved mental recovery from stress and fatigue.\nSolutions : A dose-response relationship has been found with exposure to indoor nature, with research finding that as workday nature contact increased, perceived job stress, subjective\nhealth complaints and sickness absence decreased.\n Researchers also hypothesize that access to outdoor green spaces impacts mental health and well-being through cognitive\nrestoration, and that physiological and emotional changes take place, when individuals are exposed to natural settings.\n The benefits of nature access have been found across age\ngroups, and supporting access to outdoor green and natural spaces can support the health and well-being of a wide range of individuals within a built community.\nPART 1 PROVIDE NATURE ACCESS INDOORS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project's floor plan is designed such that at least 75% of workstations, conference room seats, classroom seats\nand seating within common spaces meets at least one of the following requirements: \na. Have a direct line of sight to indoor plant(s), water feature(s) and/or nature view(s).\nb. Are within {{well-unit}}33 ft|10 m{{/well-unit}} of indoor plant(s), water feature(s) and/or nature view(s).\nNote :\nWater features that may produce water aerosols (e.g., decorative fountains) cannot be installed in hospitals,\nhealthcare settings or senior living facilities.\nPART 2 PROVIDE NATURE ACCESS OUTDOORS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Outdoor nature\nOne of the following requirements is met:\na. Outdoor nature access facilitated by the conditions below: \n1. One or more outdoor spaces that collectively total at least 5% of the project interior area are available to all\nregular occupants.\n2. At least 70% of the outdoor space must be covered by plants, water or other natural elements. Use the area of\neach tree or shrub canopy to calculate their contributions to the total area. \nb. Nearby nature access facilitated by the conditions below:\n1. At least one green space or blue space is within a {{well-unit}}650 ft|200 m{{/well-unit}} walk distance from the\nproject boundary and available to all regular occupants during open hours of the space(s). \n2. Total combined green space must be at least {{well-unit}}1.25 acre|0.5 hectare{{/well-unit}}.\n2: Outdoor nature access\nThe following requirement is met:\na.

In the workplace, employees that smoke incur greater\nabsences, take more sick days and have higher health care costs than non-smoking employees.  Despite tobacco’s impact, national comprehensive health services that fully or partially\ncover services to support tobacco cessation are only available in 24 countries, benefiting just 15% of the world’s population.\n Although 70% of U.S. adult smokers are interested in\nquitting and 40% of smokers attempt to quit each year, only 8% of smoking employees report that their workplace offers smoking cessation assistance.\nSolutions : Employers can play a key role in supporting employee tobacco cessation efforts.  Among those who attempt to quit, counseling and medication more than double the chance\nof quitting success.  Worksite-based incentives and competitions, when combined with additional interventions to support individual cessation efforts, can be effective in reducing\ntobacco use among workers.  Another influencing factor on tobacco use is an individual’s proximity to outlets where it is sold.  Restricting the sale of tobacco on-site is a key strategy for\npreventing or curbing use of tobacco products, as well as providing support to those trying to quit.\n   \nPART 1 PROVIDE TOBACCO CESSATION RESOURCES (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Incentive program and cessation resources\nThe following requirements are met:\na. The project or organization implements a tobacco cessation program for all eligible employees that meets the\nfollowing:\n1. Focuses on increasing or improving motivation or action to quit, or maintaining quit effort.\n2. Includes incentives or rewards (e.g., direct financial payments, lottery for prizes) provided for participation in\nquit effort or success in abstaining from tobacco use.\n   \nb. Tobacco cessation resources are available to all eligible employees at no cost or are subsidized and meet the\nfollowing:\n1. Resources referring tobacco users to tobaco cessation telephone quit lines or online quitting resources.\n2. Tobacco cessation counseling. Programs may be provided in-person or virtually; in group or individual\nsettings; through vendors, on-site staff, health insurance plans or programs, community groups or other\nqualified professionals (e.g., tobacco cessation specialist).\n3. Prescription tobacco cessation medications and nicotine replacement products (e.g., inhalers, nasal sprays,\nbupropion, varenicline).\n4. Over-the-counter nicotine replacement products (e.g., nicotine gum, patches, lozenges).\n \nPART 2 LIMIT TOBACCO AVAILABILITY (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor Retail Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met for projects where retail products are sold on a daily basis:\na. Sale of tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) is prohibited.\nb. Tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) are not marketed or promoted.\nREFERENCES\n1. World Health Organization.

Harmful use of alcohol is a leading global risk factor, accounting for 3.3\nmillion deaths per year (or 5.9% of all deaths) and 5.1% of the global burden of disease in 2014.  Within the workplace, alcohol use is a significant risk factor for absenteeism,\npresenteeism, accidents and employee turnover.\n It is also estimated that approximately half of the overall social costs of alcohol are due to lost productivity.  In addition to alcohol,\nillicit drug use remains a serious global public health concern: in 2013, 246 million people between 15 and 64 years of age used illicit drugs, of which one in ten suffered from a drug use\ndisorder or dependency.\nSolutions : Prevention programs that address substance use through education and workplace policy, as well as available and affordable screening and treatment offerings, have been\nshown to be effective methods of preventing unhealthy substance use habits and supporting those struggling with substance abuse and addiction.\n The return on investment in\noffering substance use treatment and prevention services is known. For example, each $1 invested in screening and brief counseling interventions saves approximately $4 in health care\ncosts.  Offering prevention, education and support services provides an opportunity to reduce the costs companies face as a result of undiagnosed and untreated substance abuse.\nPART 1 OFFER SUBSTANCE USE EDUCATION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Substance use policy and education\nThe following requirements are met:\na. A policy is in place regarding the use of alcohol, legal and recreational drugs on-site and is clearly communicated\nto all regular occupants.   \nb. Trainings (in the form of education seminars, workshops or classes) are offered at least once per year to regular\noccupants and addresses the following topics: \n1. Management of personal substance use, covering, at minimum, safe substance use habits, signs of dependency\nor addiction and short- and long-term health risks associated with substance misuse or addiction.\n2. Prescription opioid education, covering, at minimum, questions to ask at point of prescribing, safe use (e.g.,\nstorage, disposal, driving while using) and risks and signs of dependency or addiction.\n3. How to appropriately respond to a peer struggling with substance use, covering, at minimum, how to support\na peer's recovery efforts and what to do in the case of relapse or a substance use emergency (e.g., withdrawal,\noverdose).\n \nc. Training is provided in-person or virtually; in group or individual settings; through vendors, on-site staff, health\ninsurance plans or programs, community groups or other qualified practitioners or programs (e.g., Mental Health\nFirst Aid).\nPART 2 PROVIDE SUBSTANCE USE AND ADDICTION SERVICES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met for all eligible employees:\na. Substance use and addiction services are available at no cost or subsidized and include at a minimum:\n1.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCOMMUNITY\nThe WELL Community concept aims to support access to essential healthcare, build a culture of health that\naccommodates a variety of population needs and establish an engaged occupant community.\nWithin every built space there exists a unique community of people with varied backgrounds who are linked by social\nties, share common perspectives and engage in joint action and experiences in shared settings or locations.   The\nglobal, national and local conditions that impact the health of each individual in a community are known as the social\ndeterminants of health, which include physical determinants, or the physical and built conditions that impact\nhealth.\n Determinants of health can influence health disparities, which are the differences in health status between\npopulation groups resulting from unequal distribution of power and resources as a function of gender, race, ethnicity\nor socio-economic status.  For example, many people worldwide still struggle with low health literacy and limited\naccess to basic health services, which varies based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, sex, disability status,\nsexual orientation, gender identity and residential location.\n Additionally, an estimated 235 million urban families\nlive in substandard housing, leading to poor health outcomes like asthma, infectious disease and cardiovascular\nevents.\n Policies and services that support working caregivers, like new parents, are critical to a supportive\nworkplace culture of health, but are not universally provided.\n Exclusive hiring and promotion practices also\npresent barriers to advancement for specific populations: only 55% of U.S. companies report racial diversity as a\npriority, and in the UK, women's earnings are only 80.2% of men's.\n Furthermore, built spaces vary greatly in how\nthey are designed and operated, and because occupants have a wide range of needs and abilities, many environments\nare not designed with these differening requirements in mind.\n Projects that do not consult stakeholders\nduring the planning process or neglect to gather their feedback after occupancy often fail to holistically serve\nstakeholder needs.\nPromoting community well-being must begin with supporting the fundamental factors that influence individual and\ncollective health. Providing increased and affordable access to comprehensive health services supports better\nindividual and community health outcomes, reducing health disparities and overall healthcare costs.\n Health\npromotion programs, from immunization programs and on-demand services to paid sick leave policies and incentive-\nbased initiatives, can improve employee job satisfaction, self-esteem and overall health, while reducing health\nrisks.\n Collecting stakeholder input through charrettes and establishing health-oriented goals early on, and\nutilizing post-occupancy surveys to ask occupants about their satisfaction with their environment, can help a project\nidentify and meet objectives that support the health of all stakeholders while bringing employers significant returns on\ninvestment.\nFurthermore, supporting working caregivers through strategies like childcare support,\nworkplace breastfeeding support, and paid parental leave can provide numerous benefits, including higher rates of\nbreastfeeding, reduced infant mortality and long-term achievement for children.\n Companies that foster\ncivic engagement and espouse fair and just treatment toward their workforce can increase employee attraction and\nretention, and improve financial returns, while building a supportive culture.\nEstablishing an emergency\nmanagement plan, and providing emergency resources like AEDs, first aid kits and preparedness trainings, is crucial to\ncollective safety during emergencies.\nCreating plans to support business continuity, remote work readiness and\nproject re-entry after extended remote periods helps maintain business resilience and individual well-being during\nand after longer-lasting emergencies.\nIn addition to health-promoting policies and programs, design plays a critical role in addressing the physical\ndeterminants of health and making buildings accessible and safe for all. Supportive spaces both comply with\naccessibility codes and also incorporate universal design principles that enable people of all needs, abilities and\nidentities to use a space.\nFinally, incorporating affordable housing units can help improve overall health and provide\na stable platform for the delivery of essential services for low-income populations.\n \nThe WELL Community concept promotes the implementation of design, policy and operations strategies that focus on\naddressing engagement and belonging, as well as establishing a culture of health. Providing access to health services,\nsupportive and health-promoting policies, and design that enables all individuals to access, participate and thrive\nwithin a space can build a foundation for health. \nNote : Read more about the evidence behind the WELL Community Concept.

Low health literacy is linked to lower use of\npreventive care (e.g., flu shots), poor management of chronic conditions (e.g., high blood pressure) and lower self-reported mental and physical health.\n Studies estimate that low\nhealth literacy costs the U.S. economy anywhere between $70-240 billion each year.\nSolutions : Multi-modal programming, educational materials and communications can help promote health literacy and increase positive health outcomes.\nBy supporting awareness of\nhealth and wellness programs and policies, projects can promote health literacy and encourage engagement with health resources, leading to both individual benefits - like increased\nparticipation in healthy behaviors and use of health services - and also employer benefits, providing an estimated 4:1 return on investment.\n \nPART 1 PROVIDE WELL FEATURE GUIDE\nFor All Spaces:\n1: WELL feature guide\nA physical or digital WELL feature guide, such as the WELL report, will be prominently displayed and/or made widely\navailable to all occupants upon certification achievement or completion of a review cycle, meeting the following\nrequirements:   \na. Describes the WELL features achieved by the project or organization.\n2: Communications\nThe following requirement is met: \na. Quarterly communications (e.g., emails, modules, trainings) are sent to regular occupants, and onboarding\ncommunications are given to new employees (as applicable), about health resources, programs, amenities and\npolicies available to them addressed by the WELL features achieved by the project or organization.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Collecting varied stakeholder input can help a project identify and address its essential goals for health promotion and\nincorporate design that best celebrates the project’s unique identity, culture and place, creating a space that meets the needs of all stakeholders and enriches the well-being of both\noccupants and visitors.\n Establishing a health-centered mission and orienting stakeholders to how the project will adhere to that mission through design and operations, including\nWELL features, can help individuals remain engaged in the space and empower them to utilize all available health and wellness programs and policies.\nPART 1 FACILITATE STAKEHOLDER CHARRETTE\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Stakeholder charrette\nEarly in the planning process for the pursuit of a WELL designation, representatives from the organization or project\nteam (e.g., leadership, human resources, project managers) facilitate a collaborative discussion that meets the\nfollowing requirements:\na. Includes representative key stakeholders including (as applicable):\n1. Owner.\n2. Facilities manager.\n3. Architects and engineers.\n4. Contractors.\n5. Employees or other occupants.\n6. Community members (if the project or organization has substantial impact on the surrounding community).\nb. Identifies the health and well-being needs of your occupants.   \nc. Identifies your organization’s objectives for health promotion. \nd. Defines goals, related to each of the following:\n1. Occupant health and well-being. \n2. Resilience. \n3. Energy and resource management.\n4. Protection of water resources and ecosystems. \n5. Healthy and sustainable material cycles. \n6. Community inclusion. \n7. Clean and healthful local environments. \n2: Stakeholder orientation\nTours of the space, communicating existing building operations, maintenance, programs and policies support\nadherence to WELL requirements, are conducted and made available to the following groups:  \na. All stakeholders in the development process, including (as applicable) the owner, manager, facilities management\nteam, architects, engineers, existing employees, occupants, residents, contractors and community members.  \nb. New employees during onboarding.\nPART 2 PROMOTE HEALTH-ORIENTED MISSION\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization establishes a health-oriented mission that meets the following requirements:\na. Outlines the project’s or organization’s objectives for health promotion.\nb. Includes a statement about supporting and improving occupant health.\nc. Incorporates relevant organizational goals or strategies established during the stakeholder charrette.\nd. Is made available to all occupants.\nREFERENCES\n1. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

{"feature": "C03", "page_start": 226, "page_end": 227, "content": "C03 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS | P\nIntent : Enable organizations, families and individuals to prepare and respond to a variety of emergency situations.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects to undertake a risk assessment, create an emergency management plan for natural, human-caused, technological and health-related\nemergencies and educate occupants on the plan to support emergency preparedness and response.\nIssue : Natural disasters kill around 90,000 people and affect close to 160 million people worldwide every year, with both an immediate and long-term impact on human lives and built\nspaces.1 Older adults, individuals with disabilities, pregnant women and children may have special needs during an emergency and are particularly vulnerable when disaster strikes.1 The\nU.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates about 40-60% of small businesses permanently close following a disaster due to the lack of a comprehensive disaster\npreparedness plan with proper mitigation strategies.2 Beyond natural disasters, infectious disease epidemics have increased in the 21st century, involving rapid global spread due to\ntravel, trade and urbanization.3,4 The COVID-19 pandemic infected six million people and spread to almost every continent within five months, impacting the social and economic\nlivelihood of the global population on an incalculable scale.5\nSolutions : An effective emergency management plan requires an understanding of potential local hazards, the needs of vulnerable groups, the responsibilities of the emergency\nresponse team and building response capabilities.6 Emergency management plans, including risk assessments, occupant drills and enhanced emergency communications, can help\norganizations be better prepared to handle unforeseen events, minimize occupant confusion and improve coordination and safety during emergency situations.3,7–11 Robust\nemergency preparedness and response measures can also help to slow the spread of infectious disease and minimize secondary mortality.12\nPART 1 DEVELOP EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na. A risk assessment is undertaken to address at minimum the following:\n1. Identify project assets (e.g., employees, facilities).\n2. Establish a process for occupants or groups who may be more vulnerable (e.g., older adults, people with\ndisabilities, pregnant women, children) to confidentially identify specific needs they may have during an\nemergency.\n3. Evaluate potential impacts of relevant hazards and identify high-risk hazards.\n4. Determine emergency management planning priorities.\nb. An emergency management plan is in place outlining response in the case of emergency situations within the\nbuilding or surrounding community, addressing at minimum the following hazards:\n1. Natural (e.g., flood, tsunami, wildfire, earthquake, heatwave).\n2. Fire.\n3. Health (e.g., acute medical emergency, infectious disease pandemic).\n4. Technological (e.g., power loss, chemical spill, explosion).\n5. Human-caused (e.g., civil unrest, active shooter, terrorism).\nc. The emergency management plan meets the following requirements:\n1. Incorporates annual (at minimum) inventory and maintenance of building emergency response resources (e.g.,\nfirst aid kits, automated external defibrillators (AEDs), emergency notification system, personal protective\nequipment) and operations capabilities (e.g., backup power, remote management systems).\n2. Includes a list of specialized personnel that is updated annually (at minimum) and includes roles and contact\ninformation of the emergency response team.\n3. Plan is reviewed and updated (as needed) on an annual basis and is easily accessible to all regular occupants.  \nd. Regular occupants are provided education and training on emergency preparedness and response, including the\nfollowing:\n1. Communications about the emergency management plan and related resources, including guidance by\nrelevant local-, state-, regional- or global-level emergency response agencies (e.g., WHO, government\nemergency management agency or equivalent), annually (at minimum), to employees during new employee\nonboarding and during an emergency event.\n2. Practice drills or other operations-based or discussion-based exercises conducted annually (at minimum) for\neach high-risk hazard identified in the risk assessment, and conducted every two years (at minimum) for other\nhazards covered under the emergency management plan.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Employers do not often put\nmethods in place to systematically gather input on the experience of their employees, such as satisfaction with policies, design and maintenance or feelings of overall health.\nSolutions : Surveys are an established tool for understanding and evaluating people’s perceptions of indoor environmental conditions, wellness policies and personal health and well-\nbeing.\nPsychometrically validated surveys and questions ensure that sensitive questions are framed appropriately and measure what they are intended to measure, and when\ncombined with environmental satisfaction questions can effectively capture high-quality data.\n Employees who perceive that their employer acts on their feedback are four times\nmore likely to stay with their company; moreover, investing in the employee experience can reduce turnover and absenteeism and increase productivity, retention and engagement.\nSurveys that ask building users about their satisfaction with indoor environmental quality and workplace wellness amenities and policies help evaluate the effectiveness of existing health\nand wellness interventions, identify opportunities to create a healthier environment and bring employers significant returns on investment.\nPART 1 SELECT PROJECT SURVEY\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Pre-approved survey\nFor projects with ten or more eligible employees, the following requirement is met:\na. A survey is selected from a survey provider listed on Reference.\nOption 2: Custom survey\nFor projects with ten or more eligible employees, the following requirement is met:\na. A survey is created that covers the topics listed in Appendix C1.\nOption 3: Small employee population\nThe following requirement is met:\na. There are fewer than 10 eligible employees in this project.\nPART 2 ADMINISTER ANNUAL SURVEY AND REPORT RESULTS\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Survey administration\nThe following requirements are met:\na.   All eligible employees are invited to participate in the survey annually. Regular reminders are sent to eligible\nemployees to complete the survey.\nb.   Survey protects all participant-identifying data through appropriate measures such as anonymous reporting and\nsafe data storage. Any communication of results should be on an aggregated basis, such that no participant can be\nidentified.\nc.   Analysis of responses is conducted by a qualified survey professional.\n2: Result reporting\nThe project or organization annually submits, through the platform, the following:\na. Project and survey data, including:\n1. Total number of employees invited to complete the survey and number of employees who completed the\nsurvey.\n2. Date survey started and finished.\n3. Project location.\n4. Project type.\n5. Level of WELL achievement, if applicable (e.g., WELL Health-Safety Rated).\nb.   Aggregated, anonymized survey results.\nREFERENCES\n1.

{"feature": "C06", "page_start": 233, "page_end": 236, "content": "C06 HEALTH SERVICES AND BENEFITS | O (MAX : 5 PT )\nIntent : Support the overall health and well-being of individuals and their families by offering comprehensive health benefits, policies and services.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects to provide access to essential and on-demand health services, paid sick leave and immunizations.\nIssue : Access to basic healthcare services is one of five key pillars that form the social determinants of health.  Access includes physical or geographic access, affordability, and quality or\nacceptability of care, and access varies based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity and location.\nUnvaccinated\nindividuals pose a risk to public health, and seasonal flu causes severe illness and death in high-risk populations, costing the $10.4 billion in annual healthcare costs; the average\nhospitalized flu case in Canada costs $11,092.\n Delays between identifying a need for care and receiving services can increase complications, costs andhospitalization.\n Moreover,\nwhile 94% of the world’s countries mandate paid sick leave, the U.S. and Korea are the only OECD countries that do not, and 40% of American employees have no sick leave.\n Studies\nestimate that 20 million Americans and 37% of employees in the United Kingdom go to work sick because they lack sick leave or have only one-day sick leave, respectively, infecting\ncolleagues as a result.\n Employees may also go into work when sick if their sick leave does not offer sufficient wage replacement.\nSolutions : Basic essential healthcare services include medical, dental, vision, mental health, substance use, preventive screenings, disease management and biometric\nassessments.  Providing free on-site flu vaccines with education on good health habits can increase vaccination rates and reduce flu cases.\n Providing timely access to health services\ncan relieve both actual and perceived barriers to care.\n Studies demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of employees seek one-on-one benefits consultation and flexible\ncoverage options so they can opt into coverage that best meets their individual schedule and health needs.  Studies also show that implementing paid sick leave reduces contagion in\nthe workplace, improves employee productivity and reduces employee turnover.\n Overall, enhancing access to essential healthcare and paid sick leave can help improve the\nphysical, social and mental health of individuals and communities.\nPART 1 PROMOTE HEALTH BENEFITS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nA health benefits policy meets the following requirements:\na.

Medical and absenteeism costs fall by about $3.27 and $2.73,\nrespectively, for every dollar spent on workplace health programs.  Successful health promotion programs can improve job satisfaction, sense of well-being, self-esteem and health\nstatus, and reduce stress and health risks.\n Organizational benefits include lower healthcare costs and absenteeism and improved productivity, recruitment, retention, culture and\nemployee morale.\nPART 1 PROMOTE CULTURE OF HEALTH (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Health promotion strategies\nOccupant health and well-being is promoted through the following:\na. Monthly digital communications to employees and/or regular occupants (as applicable) that address the following:\n1. Reinforce the project’s culture of health.\n2. Market health promotion policies and programs.\n3. Highlight stories from regular occupants (as applicable) who exemplify the project’s health culture. \n4. Offer education (e.g., tips and resources created by the project or a third party) on at least two topics within\nthe ten WELL concepts.\nb. Quarterly education sessions (e.g., workshops, lectures, seminars) that offer instruction on topics within the ten\nWELL concepts, covering at least two different concepts per year.\n2: Health promotion coordinators\nOne of the following is present:\na. Health promotion group that meets at least quarterly, is actively involved in planning and implementing health\npromotion programs and policies and seeks to cultivate a culture of health in the project.\nb. Paid mid- or senior-level employee that plans and implements health promotion programs. Health promotion\nmust be part of their job description, requirements and/or performance expectations. Projects that meet Part 2\nHealth Promotion Leader automatically fulfill this requirement.\nPART 2 ESTABLISH HEALTH PROMOTION LEADER (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe following requirements are met:\na. Project has at least one dedicated executive-level employee whose primary responsibility is to plan and oversee\nstrategies that promote the physical, mental and emotional health and well-being of all employees (e.g., Chief\nWellness Officer). The individual must be employed at the executive (C-Suite) level or report directly to a member\nof the executive (C-Suite) team.\nb. Executive-level employee’s job description and performance expectations must include the following:\n1. Established metrics or KPIs for promoting organizational health and well-being that are linked to employee’s\nperformance evaluation.\n2. At minimum annual reports by the employee on the progress of health promotion strategies and employee\nengagement to the executive (C-suite) team, Board of Directors and/or equivalent high-level stakeholders.\nc. Executive-level employee is supported by at minimum one employee who helps plan and implement health\npromotion programs and policies.\nREFERENCES\n1. Garrin JM.

Though infant care is a universal need, and most countries guarantee\na minimum paid maternity leave, many do not offer paid partner leave, and when they do, it is often significantly shorter in duration.  Additionally, shorter and unpaid maternity leave may\ncreate barriers to accessing necessary healthcare such as postpartum healthcare, which is critical to receive in the first six weeks after childbirth to support new mothers’ health.\nSolutions : The International Labor Organization recommends a minimum of 18 weeks of parental leave, with research indicating that 40 weeks of paid leave results in the greatest overall\nreduction of risk for low infant birth weight and infant mortality and results in higher rates of on-time infant immunizations.\n Longer paid parental leave and back-to-work coaching\nprograms are associated with numerous health benefits, including higher rates of breastfeeding, reduced infant mortality and postpartum depression, decreased risk of low birthweight\ninfants and higher paternal involvement, as well as higher long-term achievement for children, including reduced school drop-out rates and increased medical appointment\nattendance.\n Moreover, research shows that parental leave of up to a year (52 weeks) can help improve job continuity for women even years after childbirth.\n Research also\ndemonstrates that fathers who take paid leave of at least two weeks are far more engaged in childcare nine months after birth.  Organizational support for new parents can also increase\nemployee retention and company loyalty.\nPART 1 OFFER NEW PARENT LEAVE (MAX : 3 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Parental leave\nA parental leave policy that meets the following requirements is available for all eligible employees:\na. At least 40 weeks of parental leave is offered to the designated birthing parent and/or primary care giver.\nOf\nthis, at least a portion must be paid at 75% or higher of the employee’s full salary or wages and include benefits,\nper the table below.\nb. Parental leave is offered to the non-primary caregiver, of which at least a portion is paid at 75% or higher of the\nemployee’s full salary or wages and including benefits, per the table below.\nc. Leave must be separate from other types of leave (e.g., sick leave, paid time off) and may be used consecutively or\nnon-consecutively during any 12-month period during pregnancy or after birth or adoption.\nTier\nWeeks of Paid Leave for the Birthing Parent\nand/or Primary Caregiver\n \nWeeks of Paid Leave for\nNon-Primary Caregiver \nPoint Value\n1\nAt least 12 weeks\nAND\nAt least 2 weeks\n{{well-points}} 1|0.5\n{{/well-points}} point\n2\nAt least 18 weeks\nAND\nAt least 3 weeks\n{{well-points}} 2|1\n{{/well-points}} points\n3\nAt least 30 weeks\nAND\nAt least 4 weeks\n{{well-points}} 3|1.5\n{{/well-points}} points\n2: Parental support policies\nThe project or organization offers a policy that provides at least two of the following services to help employees\nutilize and return from parental leave:\na. At least one of the following upon returning from parental leave:\n1. Part-time options (e.g., ramp back programs).\n2. Work from home flexibility.\n3. Flexible schedules. \nb. Communications (e.g., emails, modules, trainings) sent to expecting parents about the parental leave policies and\nresources, including guidance on the positive health impacts of parental leave. \nc.

Caregivers often have to adjust their work schedules or take time off, which can significantly impact productivity due to increased absenteeism,\nworkday interruptions and unpaid leave.  An estimated 9% of caregivers left their jobs as a result of having to balance caregiving responsibilities with work obligations.\n Employers that\nfail to meet the needs of caregiving employees can see reduced company productivity due to increased absenteeism, workday interruptions and unpaid leave, resulting in an annual\naverage loss of 3.4 billion, 2.8 billion and 1.4 billion dollars, respectively. Moreover, the loss of a loved one has been associated with higher risks of mortality, physical health problems\nleading to disability and hospitalization, and psychological stress like insomnia, depression and anxiety.\n Grief is also tied to productivity loss: in the U.S., grief-inducing experiences cost\nemployers an annual average of $75 billion in lost productivity and lost business.    \nSolutions : By offering a range of accommodations, employers can create a supportive culture that meets the needs and caretaking responsibilities of all employees.  On-site childcare\nthat supports flexible schedules can help working parents balance family needs and work demands. Flexible work arrangements can help retain and attract employees while also\nimproving employee productivity and engagement.  Additionally, financial assistance, support groups and referral to community services can help individuals manage the unique\nchallenges associated with being a caregiver.  Providing employees sufficient time away from work to grieve, in addition to grief counseling and other support, can help reduce\nemployee anxiety, depression and other health risks over time.\nPART 1 OFFER CHILDCARE SUPPORT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nAt least three of the following are provided for all employees:\na.

Companies that do not demonstrate stronger social values through civic engagement opportunities, like community\nvolunteering, have been shown to experience lower employee morale, engagement and productivity.  Moreover, research in the U.S. reveals a decline in community social support and\nrelations, with people who feel disconnected from their community encountering more mental health issues than those with a strong community connection.\nSolutions : It is essential for companies to consider the link between corporate social reputation and talent attraction.  Scheduling volunteer opportunities, providing paid volunteer time\noff, matching employee charitable contributions and working with local community organizations can foster a culture of social responsibility, enhance employee retention and make a\npositive contribution to the local community.\n There are a variety of ways to increase opportunities for civic engagement and establish a culture of social responsibility. Moreover,\nprojects that provide public use spaces and community programming can encourage social interaction and cohesion, community empowerment and collective feelings of ownership,\nreducing community health risks like stress, depression, heart disease, stroke and chronic disease and improving physical and mental health, happiness and healthy behaviors.\n   \nPART 1 PROMOTE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization has a policy that meets at least two of the following requirements:\na. All eligible employees are given the option to take paid time off to participate in volunteer activities for at least the\nequivalent of two workdays annually (separate from vacation, sick or other generally allocated paid time off).\nb. A list of local volunteer opportunities is provided to all employees, with at least one suitable opportunity per\nmonth and at least eight hours organized by the employer with a registered charity or non-profit per year.\nc. Employer matches employee’s contributions to a registered charity or non-profit of employee’s choice, up to a\nmaximum annual amount defined by the employer.\nd. At least one community engagement program (e.g. events, talks, workshops, trainings or other public engagement\nintended to promote education, play, physical activity, social connection and/or well-being) at no cost to the\npublic on a quarterly basis on- or off-site.\n \nPART 2 PROVIDE COMMUNITY SPACE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Public space\nThe project designates outdoor or indoor space for public use at no cost that meets the following requirements: \na. At least {{well-unit}}2,000 ft |186 m {{/well-unit}}.\nb. Open at all times, unless closed for security purposes (e.g., during nighttime hours) or temporarily for special\nevents.\nc. Signage or other communication clearly indicates hours the space is open and the designation for public use.\nd. Provides quality seating areas and is easily navigable for individuals of all abilities.\nOption 2: Community event space\nOne or more indoor or outdoor spaces within the project boundary are open for public convenings (e.g., local\ncommunity groups, student clubs, non-profit organizations) at no cost that meets the following requirements: \na. Has the capacity to hold to least 10 people.\nb. Is available for meetings and/or events (e.g., pop-up health services, community meetings) on a weekly basis, at a\nminimum.\nREFERENCES\n1. Deloitte.

It is estimated that only 30% of employees in the United\nStates who are harassed on the basis of protected classes (e.g., gender, race, disability) file internal complaints.\n Other barriers to reporting include lack of anonymity, company culture,\ninaccessible and inflexible reporting processes, and the unlikelihood of a positive outcome.91 For example between 2013 and 2016, just 15% of charges filed by LGBTQ+ individuals in\nthe U.S. resulted in a positive outcome for the reporting party\nSolutions : When evaluating workforce representation, organizations must account for multiple demographic factors including gender, age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,\ndisability, and more.  Addressing workforce representation is complex and touches upon all of an organization’s operations, including hiring practices, determination of compensation\nand wages, workplace culture and organizational structure. Organizations that seek to hire individuals with different backgrounds and experiences and that espouse fair treatment\ntoward all individuals in their workforce through measurable actions drive both profit and positive culture by attracting and retaining top talent and driving innovation.\nPART 1 CREATE WORKFORCE ASSESSMENT, ENGAGEMENT AND BELONGING PLAN (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization meets the following requirements:\na. An assessment of the project or organization’s current workforce demographics is conducted utilizing at least four\nof the following:\n1. Gender (assigned, identity and/or expression).\n2. Sexual orientation.\n3. Race and ethnicity.\n4. Age.\n5. Socioeconomic background.\n6. Disability.\n7. Other metric(s) as identified by the project or organization.  \nb. A workforce engagement and belonging plan is established and meets the following requirements:\n1. Identifies strategies to help all employees feel accepted, valued and included, considering findings from the\ndemographic assessment.\n2. Tracks progress toward implementing those strategies on an annual basis.\n3. Publicly summarizes annual progress (e.g., on company website, in annual report).\nPART 2 IMPLEMENT WORKFORCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization meets the following requirements: \na. Implements a comprehensive non-discrimination policy that includes the following: \n1. Reporting protocol that allows occupants to anonymously report observed or experienced discrimination,\nresulting in a review by a third party and/or internal human resource professional or other ethics or compliance\nprofessional with the offending individual to mitigate future incidents.\n2. Penalties for retaliating against or falsifying reports of bias.  \nb. Annual trainings available to all employees that include the following topics:\n1. The benefits having a workforce comprised of people with different backgrounds.\n2. Preventing, identifying and navigating observed or experienced discrimination. \n3. Preventing, identifying and reducing bias.  \nc. Provides employees with resources (e.g., budget, meeting space, information, access to external support groups)\nto establish employee resource groups (ERGs) that are focused on fostering engagement and belonging within the\nworkforce.\nd. Has at least one dedicated senior-level employee whose primary responsibility is to plan and oversee strategies\nthat promote workforce engagement and belonging. The individual must have a dedicated budget and be\nemployed at the executive (C-Suite) level or report directly to a member of the executive (C-Suite) team.\nPART 3 IMPLEMENT FAIR HIRING AND PAY PRACTICES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization meets the following requirements:\na. Implements a hiring policy that:\n90, 654 \n90\n654 \n91\n92\n.93\n6\n2\n1\nPage 246 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n1. Bans the request of salary history.\n2. Requires blind resume reviews (i.e., information is removed that could indicate race/ethnicity, gender and\nsocioeconomic background, including, at minimum, name and home address). \n3. Establishes hiring evaluation protocols with transparent performance standards (e.g., communicating job\nrequirements clearly and establishing fair and consistent performance objectives for all employees,\ndemonstrating transparency and clear expectations for every role).\n4. Establishes goals for hiring candidates with varied backgrounds, perspectives and experiences, which hiring\nmanagers are evaluated at performance reviews at least annually. \n5. Establishes having varied backgrounds, perspectives and experiences represented in mid-and executive-level\nleadership positions and/or on the board of directors.\nb. Implements a compensation policy that is made available to all employees and includes at least three of the\nfollowing:\n1. Determination of compensation independent of gender identity, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, age,\ndisability status, or religion. \n2. Provision of compensation that meets basic needs and provides some discretionary income to all employees.\n3. Compensation transparency (e.g., making employee compensation figures visible either internally, externally\nor both) or published compensation ranges for all titles.\n4.

{"feature": "C13", "page_start": 249, "page_end": 251, "content": "C13 ACCESSIBILITY AND UNIVERSAL DESIGN | O (MAX : 4 PT )\nIntent : Make spaces more accessible, comfortable and usable for people of all backgrounds and abilities.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects integrate universal design and wayfinding principles to accommodate a variety of needs and create a more supportive environment for all.\n \nIssue : More than one billion people, or about 16% of the global population, live with some type of disability, a health condition and/or impairment a person experiences.\n Although\nbuildings serve people with varying needs and abilities, many are not designed to accommodate individual requirements.\nWayfinding, or knowing how to follow a navigational route, is\nfundamental for autonomy, social integration and community access for all individuals.  People who are neurodiverse often lack internal spatial representation and awareness, so they\nfind wayfinding to be particularly challenging and mentally straining.  The “fear of getting lost” is the most frequent wayfinding challenge for people with cognitive differences.  As a\nresult, individuals tend to stick to routine or well-known trips to avoid the significant stress associated with navigating new spaces. \nSolutions : Universal design addresses multiple aspects of a space, including infrastructure, signage and technologies, and seeks to enhance the opportunity for all individuals to exist\nindependently and comfortably in that space.  Supportive spaces and places should be designed to effectively accommodate a range of individual needs.\nThere are several solutions\nthat can enhance universal design for all people and address wayfinding challenges. Easily identifiable landmarks, such as sculptures, artwork and distinct architectural elements, can\nserve as significant points of reference during the navigational process as they are often memorable.\n Additionally, printed and digital signage provides important information for\nnavigation as well as at points for decision-making.  Simple and user-friendly sitemaps that are strategically positioned at key locations throughout a building, including entrances, can\nquickly help individuals orient and move throughout a space.  Moreover, electronic maps can allow individuals to preview routes before engaging in travel.\n This format is especially\nhelpful for people who are neurodivergent as it provides individuals with greater control and the ability to choose how they navigate the environment.\n Lastly, providing wayfinding\ninformation in various formats that support a range of cultures and abilities (e.g., braille, different languages) enhances access, allowing all individuals to more easily navigate spaces.\nPART 1 INTEGRATE UNIVERSAL DESIGN (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project considers best practices in universal design to accommodate a range of disabilities and needs by\nimplementing at a minimum one strategy in each of the following categories:\na. Physical access: entry, exit and key interaction points that enable accessible entrance to the project and strategies\nthat accommodate user changes as needed (e.g., stair-free entrances, step-free egress, operable windows,\nautomatic doors), supporting ease and independence of use.\nb. Developmental and intellectual health, including sensory requirements of people who are neurodiverse: strategies\nthat use color, texture, images and other multi-sensory, visually perceptible information.\nc. Wayfinding: strategies that help individuals intuitively navigate through the project (e.g., signage, tactile maps,\nsymbols, auditory cues, information systems, images, color that considers color blindness, various languages).\nd. Policies and programs: strategies that support belonging and accommodate a range of needs (e.g., bias and\ndiscrimination training, flexible work hours for individuals with disabilities).\ne. Technology: technology (e.g., audio and visual equipment, web access, QR codes) that helps individuals fully\nutilize a space (e.g., remote access to assist blind or deaf individuals, support for those who do not speak the\nnative language), made available to all occupants at no cost.\nf. Safety: strategies that support easy access to all spaces and amenities and minimize risk of injury, confusion or\ndiscomfort (e.g., lighting or clear sightlines to increase feelings of security, service animals, emergency egress\nplans with highlighted exit points).\nPART 2 Β SUPPORT INTERIOR NAVIGATION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nPrimary circulation routes meet the following requirements:\na. Include landmarks (e.g., sculptures, water features, artwork, architectural elements) that are: \n1. Positioned at points-of-decision (e.g., intersections, elevators, stairways and emergency exits).\n2. Physically prominent and unique (e.g., due to shape, color, size, historical or cultural significance).\nb. Include amenities (e.g., restrooms, quiet areas, drinking water stations, information services) that are: \n1. Within a clear line of sight to another landmark or amenity.\n2. Located consistently throughout the project boundary (e.g., same location on each floor).\nc. Include seating areas that are located consistently throughout the project boundary (e.g., same location on each\nfloor).\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The\nfeedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that are effective and applicable to projects around the\nworld.\nPART 3 Β SUPPORT BUILDING & NEIGHBORHOOD WAYFINDING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nInformation is provided for the building in a way that meets the following requirements:\na. Is present in a physical format (e.g., printed signage, digital display) at the main building entrance and at least one\nadditional functional building entrance, if present.\n20\n5,7 \n4\n4\n5\n11\n11 \n32\n2\n11\n7, 22\n22\n11 \n9\n1,7,10\n1,10,11\n10\n1,7,10\n1,7,10\n1,10,11\n21, 22\n21\n21\n21\nPage 248 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nb. Is available in an electronic format (e.g., website, mobile application).\nc. All formats meet the following:\n1. Include audio and/or braille that is compliant with ICC/ANSI A117.1-2003.\n2. Use clear and simple language.  \n3. Include more than one language.\n4. Include contact information for assistance services (e.g., screen readers, listening systems, wayfinding apps). \nd. All formats include a local amenities directory that meets the following:\n1. Displays the location of at least 8 existing use types (as defined in Appendix V1) relative to the building.\n2. Displays the location of all public transit stops located within a 400 m [0.25 mi] walk distance of the main\nbuilding entrance, if present.\ne. If multiple businesses are present, all formats include a business directory that shows the names of businesses\nlocated within the building and their locations (e.g., floor level, room number).\nf. All formats include a site map of the building that shows the following, if present, using easily recognizable\nsymbols:\n1. Bathrooms.\n2. Drinking water stations.\n3. Information services.\n4. Areas for resting or sitting.\n5. Wayfinding landmarks.\n6. Accessible pathways.\n7. Emergency exits.\ng. All formats include a sensory map of the building that shows the following, if present, using easily recognizable\nsymbols:\n1. Restorative spaces.\n2. Loud sounds.\n3. Crowded spaces.\n4. Flashing lights.\n5. Strong smells.\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form).

Additionally, nearly 16,000 people worldwide die from preventable injuries each day, yet in most European countries, only 5-10% of the population is trained in first aid.\nWhile natural disasters kill an average of 90,000 people annually, nearly 60% of American adults have not practiced what to do in a disaster.\nMoreover, anaphylaxis causes up to 1,500\ndeaths per year in the U.S., with studies showing a delay in administering epinephrine to be a significant risk factor associated with fatal outcomes from allergen exposure.\n Finally,\ndrug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S., with overdose from opioids driving the epidemic.  \nSolutions : Rapid and effective emergency response requires coordination with local emergency responders and maintenance of emergency resources such as an emergency notification\nsystem, first aid kits and AEDs.\n Supplementing those resources with occupant training on CPR, first aid, AED use and individual and family preparedness can increase individual\nresponse time and help improve survival rates; CPR and AED training alone can increase victim survival rates by nearly 40%.\n In food allergy emergencies, quick access to and\nimmediate availability of epinephrine is essential.\n Finally, increasing the availability of naloxone is a critical component of reducing opioid-related overdose deaths, with evidence\nsuggesting that when naloxone and overdose education are available to community members, overdose deaths decrease in those communities.    \nPART 1 PROMOTE EMERGENCY RESOURCES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Emergency resources\nResources are in place that support emergency response, including at least three of the following:\na. Information indicating emergency procedures (e.g., evacuation during fire or earthquake, containment and\nresponse strategies for infectious disease outbreaks, shelter-in-place during active shooter) available to all guests\nupon entrance to the building.\nb. Building emergency notification system with auditory and visual indicators of emergency (e.g., public address\nsystems, flashing lights).\nc. At least one first aid kit per floor meeting requirements of Appendix C3.\nd. AEDs accessible to any occupant within {{well-unit}}328 feet|100 meters {{/well-unit}} and adoption of routine\nmaintenance and testing schedule.\n The locations of building AEDs are identified through posters, signs or\nother forms of communication other than on the AED itself.\ne. Undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors for food allergy emergencies.\nf. Rides for employees subsidized or reimbursed by at least 50% to destination of need for emergency situations\n(e.g., urgent medical needs, personal or family emergency), including from home to work as needed (e.g., during\npublic transit shutdown).\n2: Emergency training and personnel\nAt least two of the following are in place:\na. Emergency response team for medical emergencies, including at least one certified medical professional, first\nresponder or other qualified personnel who has received emergency medical training (e.g., Emergency Medical\nTechnician, paramedic, police, fire service, individuals certified in advanced first aid) present within the building\nduring regular business hours.\nb. Security or crisis response team for human-caused disruptions (e.g., active shooter, civil unrest).\nc. Annual availability to regular occupants of a certified training course on CPR, first aid and AED usage.\nd. Trainings to promote emergency preparedness available to regular occupants that address at least the following\ntopics:\n1. Creating evacuation or sheltering plans.\n2. Building emergency kits, supplies and go-bags.\n3. For residents, if applicable, planning communications with family or primary contacts in case of emergency.\nPART 2 PROVIDE OPIOID RESPONSE KIT AND TRAINING (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Opioid response kits\nThe following requirements are met:\na. All emergency preparedness or first aid kits include:\n1. Naloxone rescue kits. Projects may choose a single dose nasal spray, a multi-step nasal spray, a single step\ninjection or a multi-step injection.\n2. Instructions for how to prepare and administer naloxone, as well as immediate next steps after administration. \n3. A list of who on-site has received opioid response training, and their contact information.\nb. Protocol is in place for follow-up after an opioid emergency event, including a plan for:\n1. Debriefing those affected.\n1,2\n3\n4,5\n6,7\n8–10\n11\n12,13\n3,12\n10,14\n15\n16,17,18\n17\n14\n17,18\n17\nPage 251 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n2. Immediate replacement of naloxone kit following use.\n3. Replacing expired kits.\n2: Opioid response training\nThe following requirement is met:\na.

{"feature": "C15", "page_start": 254, "page_end": 256, "content": "C15 Β EMERGENCY RESILIENCE AND RECOVERY | O (MAX : 4 PT )\nIntent : Better enable individuals and communities to maintain health and well-being, and organizations to maintain business function, during and after emergencies.\nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects to create a business continuity plan, establish a re-entry plan and offer supportive resources to facilitate resilience during, and recovery\nafter, an emergency.\nIssue : Today, communities must prepare for and face emergencies ranging from natural disasters, civil unrest to public health crises. Globally, the frequency, scale and economic and\nsocial cost of disasters is increasing due to climate change, population growth and rapid urbanization.\nIn 2019, the global economic losses from disasters amounted to $232 billion,\nand the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic caused the largest global recession in history.\n Small businesses may be particularly vulnerable as research shows that about 90% of smaller\ncompanies fail after emergencies unless they can resume business operations within five days.  Emergencies such as biological events or active shooters may necessitate sheltering in the\nworkplace, while longer-term emergencies may lead to extended workplace shutdowns.\n The latter can result in extensive layoffs, while employees who continue working may be\nforced to work in higher-risk conditions or remotely in spaces not equipped to support productivity.\nSolutions : Business continuity planning is critical to help manage business disruption, restore business operations, minimize risk to employees and mitigate financial loss when\nemergencies occur.\n Establishing organizational remote work readiness can help operations run smoothly and support employee well-being and productivity when an emergency\nmakes remote work imperative.\n Moreover, employer-funded employee relief assistance can support both employee retention and well-being during and after emergencies.\n For\nemergencies that require sheltering on-site, a shelter-in-place plan is crucial to supporting occupant safety.\n Designating space for emergency public use can reduce the burden on\nmedical facilities and help patients receive immediate care.\n Re-entry plans after emergencies should consider employee needs, offer employees flexibility, assess critical\ninfrastructure systems, communicate re-entry strategies to key stakeholders and re-evaluate existing policies, operations and protocols to support a healthy and safe re-entry.\n In\ncertain types of emergencies, including epidemics and pandemics, re-entry plans may need to consider relevant vaccination, testing, and other requirements (as applicable), including\nsocial distancing and use of personal protective equipment in order to help manage risks.\nPART 1 PROMOTE BUSINESS CONTINUITY (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nProjects implement a business continuity plan (BCP) that addresses at minimum the following:\na. Determines critical business functions, processes, supporting resources and dependencies (e.g., email, internet\nconnectivity, third-party suppliers or service providers, interdependent departments).\nb. Includes a list of the roles and responsibilities of the business continuity team and convenes the team annually (at\nminimum) to review, test and update (as needed) the plan.\nc. Implements a business impact analysis to evaluate the likely effects resulting from disruption of normal business\nfunctioning due to a disaster and to identify which critical business functions should be prioritized for recovery.\nd. Conducts a remote work readiness assessment, including at minimum the following:\n1. Evaluates which employees and/or positions (if any) are able to work remotely.\n2. Evaluates which employees and/or positions (if any) have the necessary support infrastructure to work\nproductively in a remote situation.\n3. Evaluates whether organizational technology (e.g., company laptops, virtual private network (VPN)) is set up to\nsupport enterprise-wide remote work.\n4. Implements the strategies necessary to support remote work readiness as determined by the evaluation,\nincluding (as applicable) methods of communication to employees during remote work and provision for\nalternate work locations. \ne. Outlines strategies to support short- and long-term continuity in various disasters (e.g., blizzard, pandemic),\nrestore and maintain business operations following disruption and re-mobilize in response to recurring disasters.\nNote : This feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The feedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that\nare effective and applicable to projects around the world.\nPART 2 SUPPORT EMERGENCY RESILIENCE (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nProjects implement at least one of the following:\na. Designated outdoor or indoor space is made available to emergency responders, relief organizations or other\nequivalent institutions at no cost for alternative use in case of emergency (e.g., shelter during a natural disaster,\ntreatment area during a pandemic).\nb. Funding or other resources (e.g., in partnership with local agencies providing relevant services or resources such\nas vouchers, shelter, clothing, food, transportation) are provided by the employer for emergency use by\nemployees in at least two of the following critical scenarios:\n1. Sheltering from domestic violence or abuse.\n2. Quarantine due to infectious disease exposure.\n3. Damage to employee housing from a disaster. \nc. Shelter-in-place plan for emergencies in which occupants cannot leave the project (e.g., hurricane, chemical spill)\nthat includes the following:\n1. A shelter-in-place kit with resources to help occupants shelter in place within the project for at least 24 hours\n(e.g., water, food supplies, blankets, flashlights, first aid kit).\n1–3 \n1,4\n5\n6–13\n9–13\n14–17\n14,18\n19–21\n6,8,22\n23,24\n25–34\n35\n14,18\n8\nPage 253 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n2. A process for occupants or groups who may be more vulnerable (e.g., older adults, people with disabilities,\npregnant women, children) to confidentially identify specific needs they may have during a shelter-in-place\nemergency.\n3. Procedures for communicating to occupants the decision to evacuate or shelter-in-place during an\nemergency.\n4. A commitment to incorporate shelter-in-place guidelines provided by a relevant local-, regional- or global-\nlevel emergency response agency (e.g., WHO, government emergency management agency or equivalent) into\nthe plan, and to adhere to instructions provided by that agency during a shelter-in-place emergency.\n5. Annual (at minimum) occupant trainings on the shelter-in-place plan. \nNote : This feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The feedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that\nare effective and applicable to projects around the world.\nPART 3 FACILITATE HEALTHY RE-ENTRY (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nProjects establish a plan for re-entry into the project after an emergency (e.g., natural disaster, public health\nemergency) addressing at minimum the following:\na. Consultation with regular occupants before and after re-entry to understand their needs and concerns related to\nre-entry.\nb. Safety, compliance and risk inspections of water, mechanical, electrical, ventilation and life safety systems,\nincluding necessary actions to restart building and facility systems after prolonged shutdown and approval or\nclearance for safe re-entry, as applicable.\nc. A list of roles for those who will be responsible for overseeing the re-entry plan. While roles and contact\ninformation should be made available to an organization’s personnel, it is not necessary to include this information\nin the plan submitted for purposes of verifying this feature.\nd. Re-evaluation and adjustment (as needed) of human resources, workplace wellness and employee support\npolicies and amenities (e.g., use of common areas and shared spaces like wellness rooms, food provision, physical\nactivity programs) to support a safer and healthier re-entry.\ne. Policy to support phased re-entry (as needed) offering part-time options, work from home flexibility and/or\nflexible schedules for all employees (as feasible), particularly for parents and caregivers who may have specific\ndependencies (e.g., due to childcare closures or a sick family member) and vulnerable groups (e.g., people with\ndisabilities or who may be particularly vulnerable to infectious disease).\nf. Re-evaluation and adjustment (as needed) of facilities management policies and organizational protocols to\nsupport safer and healthier re-entry, including but not limited to:\n1. Crowd management and spacing and physical distancing of individuals.\n2. Heightened security measures (e.g., screening, security personnel).\n3. Access to personal protective equipment (PPE).\n4. Additional sanitization supplies and other cleaning or maintenance protocols.  \ng. Contingency planning and re-closure measures should the same hazard that forced initial closure re-occur.\nh. Frequent communications through multiple methods (e.g., emails, signage, trainings) to all relevant stakeholders,\nincluding (as applicable) employees, occupants, residents, facilities management team, contractors and\ncommunity members, on the re-entry plan, new or altered policies, operations and procedures, relevant local-,\nstate-, national- or global-level re-entry guidelines and how the project will address occupant health and safety\nconcerns.\ni. Evaluation and incorporation of re-entry guidelines (as available) provided by a relevant local-, regional- or global-\nlevel emergency response agency (e.g., WHO, government emergency management agency or equivalent) into the\nplan, and adherence to instructions provided by that agency during re-entry.\nNote : This feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The feedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that\nare effective and applicable to projects around the world.\nPART 4 ESTABLISH HEALTH ENTRY REQUIREMENTS (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces except Dwelling Units:\nProjects located in a region with heightened risk of infectious respiratory disease transmission defined by a public\nhealth authority (e.g., World Health Organization, local public health agency) require at least one of the following for\nregular occupants to enter the space:\na. Proof of vaccination or documented exemption (e.g., a medical or religious exemption), including necessary\n22\nPage 254 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc.

With lack of\naffordable housing access, an estimated 235 million urban families live in substandard housing, which exposes them to mold, dust, water leaks, lead-based paint, poor air quality,\ntemperature extremes and vermin, leading to poor health outcomes like asthma, infectious disease, cardiovascular events and children’s nervous system damage.\n In 2016, only 3.2\nmillion affordable housing units were available for the 10.4 million extremely low-income households in the United States; in India, there is a deficit of 11 million affordable units.\n In\nrural England, only 8% of housing stock is affordable compared to 20% in urban areas.  Affordable housing shortages lead to homelessness, which increases stress, substance use and\nmorbidity in adults and mental health issues and depression in youth.\nSolutions : Increasing housing affordability, quality and safety improves resident health, feelings of security and self-esteem, and increases developmental ability and nutrition levels in\nchildren.\n Affordable housing access can help prevent communicable diseases, improve overall health and provide a stable and efficient platform for the delivery of food, healthcare\nand essential services, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities.\n With rising urbanization, healthy affordable\nhousing will be critical for community health promotion.\nPART 1 ALLOCATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor Dwelling Units:\nThe project meets the following requirements:\na. A percentage of dwelling units are allocated for tenants whose incomes are at or below an income limit relative to\nthe local median household income [e.g., Area Median Income (AMI)] and adjusted for family size. Recognition is\nawarded as per the selected tier in the table below:\nTier\nUnits Allocated and Income Limited\nPoint\nValue\n1\n20% of units or more, 0 - 50% of local median OR 40% of units or more, 51 - 80% of local\nmedian\n1 point\n2\n100% of units, 0 - 80% of local median\n2 points\nb. Total annual housing costs (i.e., rent and utilities) paid by affordable unit tenants are less than 30% of the income\nlimit selected in requirement (a).\nc. Housing costs are maintained at the levels described in this feature for the duration of a project’s engagement\nwith WELL.\nd. Affordable housing units are not visually or functionally distinctive from market-rate units (if present) and have the\nsame access point into the building.\ne. In projects with 10 or more affordable housing units, at least 50% of allocated units have two or more bedrooms\nand at least 10% of allocated units have three or more bedrooms. \nNote : This feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The feedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that\nare effective and applicable to projects around the world.\nREFERENCES\n1. Housing Instability | Healthy People 2020.\n2.

Modern slavery is recognized as a violation of human rights, including\na right to health, and as a global public health issue.\n Research shows modern slavery has severe consequences for victim health and well-being, including high risk of physical injury,\nmental health issues like anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), exposure to infectious disease, suicide and limited access to healthcare.\n Reports estimate that\na majority of modern slavery victims – nearly 30 million – reside in the Asia Pacific region, where many global supply chains lead.\n Of the 195 countries in the world, only 40 have\ninvestigated labor exploitation in supply chains and almost half of all countries worldwide have yet to criminalize slavery.\n Industries found to be at highest risk for modern slavery\ninclude clothing, electronics and technology manufacturing, food and agriculture (including catering), and construction.\n The cleaning sector is also considered high-risk given the\ncomplexity and opaque operations of the industry; in 2011, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) reported that out of 315 Australian cleaning companies analysed, 37.1% were non-compliant\nwith responsible labor practices, including underpayment of wages and lack of recordkeeping.\n Businesses often do not sufficiently assess modern slavery risks in their supply chains\ndue to the complexity of supply chains reaching across sectors and regions; for example, in 2016 only 47% of UK manufacturers had adequately identified all of the suppliers in their\nsupply chain.\nSolutions : Businesses can play a critical role in helping to identify and prevent occurrences of modern slavery.\n To address modern slavery in the supply chain, companies must first\nestablish due diligence processes that comprehensively detect risks and influencing conditions.  The UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015 requires companies to establish and disclose a risk\nassessment process, anti-slavery policies and steps taken to address identified risks.  The Australian Modern Slavery Act of 2018 similarly requires entities to publish an annual report on\nactions they have taken to address modern slavery in their operations and supply chains.  Best practices also include ethical procurement policies, employee training on relevant policies\nand risk identification as well as engagement with Tier 1 suppliers and established processes for incident reporting, while “leadership” approaches include standalone modern slavery or\nhuman rights policies, deeper risk assessments into Tier 2 suppliers through Tier 6 suppliers, capability-building with suppliers, strong remediation mechanisms and slavery-specific\nperformance metrics.\n Implementing these steps also supports the achievement of U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, which calls for\neradicating forced labor, modern slavery, human trafficking and child labor by 2025.\nPART 1 DISCLOSE LABOR PRACTICES (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization meets the following requirements:\na. A comprehensive mapping of the project's or organization’s structure, operations and supply chains is conducted\nannually for Tier 1 suppliers in the following sectors (as applicable):\n1. Construction.\n2. Cleaning.\n3. Catering.\n4. Security.\n5. Maintenance. \nb. A risk assessment is conducted annually that evaluates risks in the project's or organization’s operations and Tier 1\nsuppliers (at a minimum) in the above sectors for the following practices associated with modern slavery:\n1. Worst forms of child labor.\n2. Forced labor.\n3. Traditional slavery.\n4. Bonded labor.\n5. Human trafficking. \nc. A report is completed annually that discloses the following information, is reviewed by executives in the C-Suite,\nboard of directors and/or equivalent high-level stakeholders, and published on the project or organization’s\nwebsite:\n1. Processes of evaluation and risk assessment.\n2. Results of evaluation or risk assessment, including where modern slavery risks have been identified.\n3. Statement of commitment (including established goals and policies) aimed at identifying, preventing and\nmitigating modern slavery practices in the project’s or organization’s operations and supply chain. \nNote : This feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The feedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that\nare effective and applicable to projects around the world.\nPART 2 IMPLEMENT RESPONSIBLE LABOR PRACTICES (MAX : 2 PT )\nNote : Projects may only achieve this part if Part 1 is also achieved.\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization implements an action plan that meets the following requirements:\na.

Women are disproportionately affected, with violence most commonly perpetrated by\nmen against women.  The World Health Organization estimates that around 30% of women who have been in a relationship experience some form of physical and/or sexual violence\nperpetrated by an intimate partner.  The impact of this violence is severe: globally, it is estimated that up to 38% of murders of women are committed by a male intimate partner.  Beyond\nfatal outcomes, domestic violence can lead to a range of adverse health consequences, including higher risk of injuries, sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), depression, anxiety\nand substance misuse.  Moreover, the social and economic consequences of domestic violence are significant, including loss of wages and inability to work, as well as increased risk of\nhomelessness.\n The deep impacts of domestic violence are not just felt at home, but also carried into the workplace: research shows that at work, victims are more likely to have\nreduced performance and productivity and increased absenteeism and turnover.\nSolutions : Workplaces can play a role in responding to domestic violence through policies designed to protect and support victims.\n It is also important for workplaces to develop\nsupportive and non-judgemental environments in which employees feel comfortable and safe disclosing any violent situation they may be facing.  Employers can help protect victims\nthrough various measures, such as confidential protocols for reporting, reviewing and responding to an incident, ability to change workplace location and start and finish times,\nincreased security for workplace access, call screening procedures and specific emergency response procedures.\n Countries such as New Zealand, the Philippines and parts of Canada\nhave introduced legislation that promotes best practices among employers to support victims of domestic violence, including paid time off for victims and financial resources to support\nrelocation.\n By providing policies and resources to support victims and educate employees, employers may play a role in helping to reduce the physical and mental impacts of\ndomestic violence.\nPART 1 SUPPORT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Domestic violence policy\nThe project or organization makes available to all eligible employees a domestic violence policy that meets the\nfollowing requirements: \na. Provides employees who are victims of domestic violence at least ten days of leave, paid at the employee’s full\nsalary or wages, during any 12-month period. Leave must meet the following requirements:\n1. Distinct from paid time off, sick leave and family leave.\n2. If requiring incident disclosure for employees to qualify, takes steps to protect employee privacy.\n3. Does not require a prerequisite minimum qualifying period of employment before an employee is eligible to\ntake leave.\nb. Outlines a clear protocol for incident reporting and response that includes the following:\n1. Process for employees to confidentially report incidents of domestic violence, including one or more\ndesignated contacts that employees can approach confidentially for support when reporting incidents.\n2. Process of incident response that includes consultation with the victim, prioritizes victim privacy and safety\nand ensures incident disclosure will not adversely impact victim employment status.\nc. Offers employees who report domestic violence incidents at least two of the following:\n1. Flexible working arrangements (e.g., adjusted work hours or location).\n2. Heightened security measures (e.g., call screenings, controlled workplace access, duress alarms, changes to\ncontact information, worksite security escorts).\n3. Referrals to local support organizations, community groups and crisis lines, including those available through\nEmployee Assistance Programs (EAPs).\n4. Temporary accommodations or financial support to cover the costs of temporary accommodations.\nd. Policy and related resources provided by the organization are easily and confidentially available (e.g., via a health\nportal, mailed communications, employee website) to all employees and reviewed and adjusted (as needed)\nannually by the organization. Policy must be made available to all new employees during onboarding.\n2: Employee education\nThe project or organization offers in-person or virtual trainings (e.g., workshops, seminars) that meet the following\nrequirements:\na. Are required of all managers and made available to all employees.\nb. Covers the following topics:\n1. The relevant domestic violence policy and resources.\n2. Signs and symptoms that a person may be a victim of domestic violence.\n3. How to appropriately respond if a colleague or direct report discloses that they or another employee is\nexperiencing domestic violence.\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form).

Discrimination and bias\nresult in differences in access to economic, social and educational support have historically kept marginalized populations from achieving gainful employment.\n Financial wellness also\nimpacts mental health, housing stability and food security.\nSolutions : Research shows that minorities and women benefit from peer-to-peer mentors and sponsors who champion them.\n Sponsors provide a deeper level of mentorship to their\nprotegees.  Through exposure and relationships, they provide career advancement opportunities for the protegee when they are “in and out of the room”.  Mentorship develops trust\nbetween the two parties, creating a foundation for a successful relationship between mentor and mentee.  Mentorship surveys also reveal satisfaction amongst employees within such\nprograms – in the United States, 71% of employees with a mentor say their company provides them with excellent or good opportunities to advance their careers.  Employees may also\nbenefit from other support options such as speaker sessions, workshops and seminars.  Guest speakers can help advance professional development, spark new ideas and offer follow-up\ntraining opportunities.\n Providing subsidized financial assistance to promote education for marginalized populations may create more opportunities for career advancement and,\ntherefore, bring greater financial stability for individuals and their families.\n Research from the United States found that 80% of employees agreed that their employer’s tuition\nassistance program makes them more likely to stay with the organization, and 71% of respondents rated tuition assistance as the best or among the best benefits offered by their\nemployer (excluding health care benefits).\n Financial assistance for education and peer-to-peer mentorship positively impacts all employees, and in particular, individuals who have\nhistorically had more barriers to education and professional development.\nPART 1 ESTABLISH EDUCATION AND SUPPORT (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nOption 1: Tuition assistance\nThe project or organization provides a Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which may be limited to select institutions,\nto all eligible employees that meets the following requirement: \na. Pays for a minimum of 75% of educational expenses for all enrolled courses each term/year (including tuition,\nprogram fees and books/materials) for vocational training, undergraduate, graduate, certificate courses and similar\neducational goals. Assistance is structured per the table below:\nTier  Tuition Assistance\nStructure\nPoint Value\n1\nReimbursements\nfor educational\nexpenses\n{{well-points}}\n1|0.5 {{/well-\npoints}} point\n2\nDirect payments for\neducational\nexpenses\n{{well-points}} 2|1\n{{/well-points}}\npoint\n \nOption 2: Mentorship program\nThe project or organization provides a mentorship or sponsorship program that meets the following requirements:\na. A process for matching mentor to mentee and/or sponsor to protégé (e.g., interest form).\nb. A plan development process co-created between mentor and mentee or sponsor and protégé to identify the\nneeds, goals and objectives. The plan should be customized and focus on individual strengths, personality, skills\nand workstyles. \nc. A process by which mentees and protégés report on meetings between the mentor/mentee or sponsor/protégé\nand participation in activities recommended by the mentor or sponsor. \nd. An allocated budget for specialized resources or training related to professional development (e.g., conferences,\ncourses, assessments, workshops, group sessions) for all participating mentees and/or protégés.\ne. Mandatory training about explicit and implicit bias (in the form of educational seminars, workshops, classes or on-\ndemand modules) for all participating employees before engagement in the program.\nNote : This Option is worth {{well-points}}1|0.5{{/well-points}} point\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form).

These communities were the original stewards of land and biodiversity for millennia, making significant contributions to society through traditional and ancient\nknowledge.\n On a global scale, Indigenous Peoples and people across the African diaspora have witnessed their rightful and sacred lands being taken against their will through Doctrine\nof Discovery, broken agreements, and abuse of eminent domain and legal constructs such as heirs’ property laws.\n  In the United States, Asian and African American communities have\nmade significant contributions to the building of the country through forced and unjust labor.\n In addition, significant contributions through forced labor have occurred in South\nAmerica and the Caribbean region.\n The harmful impacts of global colonization have led to disparities in physical, mental, emotional and economic well-being, long-term\ndisplacement, erased histories, and a breakdown of community, social and economic structures, the effects of which have passed down through generations.\n Studies have shown\nthis has caused historical trauma and that the mental health of Indigenous youth still suffers on the Historical Loss Scale.  This intergenerational trauma has been found in DNA at the\ncellular level.\n In Australia, New Zealand and North America, recent truth and reconciliation acknowledgments, laws and reparations have begun for Indigenous People who have\nsuffered various human rights violations, including land rights abuse and attempted genocide.\n It is important that organizations work with representatives from within the affected\ncommunity and/or Tribal Nation to ensure that their acknowledgement and reconciliation and/or reparations programs do no harm, as defined by the community.\nSolutions : This feature seeks to acknowledge and begin reconciliation for at least a portion of the valuable contributions from affected populations by encouraging healing and\nconnection that is grounded in place and culturally-relevant values.\n The act of reconciliation illuminates and drives awareness of historical contributions of marginalized and\ncolonized communities through action and future-facing programs (i.e., land acknowledgments, truth and reconciliation practices, empowerment programs, financial relief and\neconomic development). \nPART 1 PROVIDE HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nThe project or organization develops and implements a comprehensive historical acknowledgment program that\nmeets the following requirements:\na. Review land deeds, historical records, census data or other credible sources (e.g., articles, websites, surveys) to\nidentify a community that has historically suffered as a result of colonization, displacement and relocation.\nb. Conduct an assessment to determine if any of the organization’s current practices or policies are harmful to the\ncommunity receiving acknowledgment, including, at a minimum, the following: \n1. Discriminatory and harmful labor practices and the implicit biases, policies and structures that lead to them,\nincluding those impacting consultants and subcontractors (e.g., collaborative partnerships that may cause\nrepresentational damage, poor working conditions, participation in modern slavery and privatized prison labor,\nsalary inequity, discriminatory hiring practices and/or lack of representation in leadership).\n2. Occupancy on sacred land (e.g., burial sites, spiritual sites), land protected treaty or agreement (e.g., hunting\nand gathering rights), or seized land (e.g., by use of eminent domain).\n3. Practices that negatively impact all life and the environment, especially those in closest proximity to the\nproject site (e.g., pollution, deforestation, poor waste management practices).\nc. Create a program for historical acknowledgement that:\n1. Is informed by members and leaders of the community and/or Tribal Nation, as identified through one or more\nmeetings with community representatives. \n2. Acknowledges the beliefs and practices of the community and/or Tribal Nation.\n3. Promotes engagement including reconciliation and/or reparations (as applicable) between the organization\nand the community and/or Tribal Nation. \n4. Identifies a minimum three-year plan of action for how the organization will develop a meaningful relationship\nwith the community and/or Tribal Nation that will benefit the community (e.g., employment incubator, mental\nhealth support, funding agreement, education opportunities, returning land or property).\n5. Includes a signed document acknowledging the partnership demonstrating the program was co-created\nbetween the organization and the community and/or Tribal Nation.   \nd. Develop a communication plan in a physical or electronic format that provides:\n1. Education for employees and the general public about the community and/or Tribal Nation’s historical\ncontribution to society. \n2. Background on the historical acknowledgement program and its development, as well as opportunities for\nemployees to engage with the plan of action.  \ne. Express historical context publicly through at least one of the following methods:\n1. Mission statement\n2. Monument\n3. Proclamation\n4. Educational display\n5. Plaque\n1–3\n4–6\n2,3\n6–9 \n1,10–12\n13\n14\n4,12,15\n16–20\nPage 265 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n6. Website\n7.

{"feature": "C21", "page_start": 268, "page_end": 271, "content": "C21 \u0000 MULTISENSORY DESIGN | O (MAX : 4 PT )\nIntent : Support neuro-inclusion through an informed planning process, multisensory design strategies and stakeholder education. \nSummary : This WELL feature requires projects to facilitate a stakeholder charrette with a qualified neuro-inclusion professional, implement multisensory design strategies throughout\nthe project and educate employees on neuro-inclusion. \nIssue : Neurodiversity refers to the difference in neurocognitive profiles across an entire population.  It is estimated that 15-20% of the world's population exhibits some form of\nneurodivergence.  Human brains are unique and vary; therefore, the way people interact with the environment can differ for each person.\n Neurocognition encompasses a wide range\nof profiles. This includes neurotypical, which describes someone fitting a majority neurological profile, as well as neurodivergent, which describes someone considered outside a majority\nor neurotypical neurological profile.\n People who are neurodivergent have unique sensory processing needs and may experience the environment at heightened or lower intensity\nlevels.\n Companies actively hire people who are neurodiverse but few understand how to create supportive spaces.\n Traditional design often overlooks the specific needs of people\nwho are neurodivergent as spaces are usually designed for neurotypical users.\n This leads to environments that are not supportive of people who are neurodivergent, which may\nhinder their ability to focus, cause anxiety and limit their participation.\n Although research is limited, there is a growing body of knowledge that is informing neuro-inclusive design. \nSolutions : Due to the complex and nuanced nature of creating multisensory design strategies, it is important for qualified neuro-inclusion professionals and people who are\nneurodivergent to be engaged throughout the integrated planning and design process.\n Qualified professionals can help identify and implement evidence-based goals and solutions.\nPeople who are neurodiverse can guide design decisions towards those that will be most important, impactful and supportive based on their lived experience.  Creating spaces for\nneuro-inclusion also requires the implementation of multisensory design strategies to address individual differences in sensory processing. High-stimulation design strategies support\nhypo-sensitive individuals who may experience understimulation, while low-stimulation design strategies support hyper-sensitive individuals who may experience overstimulation.\nIndividual control, access to nature, as well as acoustic and lighting elements are additional factors that support self-regulation and psychological safety for all individuals, regardless of\nhow people process stimuli.\n In addition, ensuring that multisensory design strategies are sequenced can help provide natural transitions and a balance of sensory spaces\nthroughout.\n Finally, stakeholder education can help communicate the benefits of neuro-inclusive design strategies and policies to all.\nPART 1 PLAN FOR NEURO-INCLUSION (MAX : 1 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nFacilitate a stakeholder charrette that meets the following requirements:\na. Is hosted early in the WELL planning process (may be part of the stakeholder charrette listed in Feature C02 Part\n1).\nb. Involves a qualified neuro-inclusion professional.\nc. ​Includes efforts to involve representatives from the following stakeholders, as applicable:\n1. Owners.\n2. Organizational representatives who identify as neurodivergent. \n3. Interior design professionals (e.g., interior designer, facilities planner, lighting specialist, acoustics specialist).\n4. Human resources.\n5. Facilities managers.\n6. Architects. \n7. Engineers.\n8. Contractors.\nd. Accommodates participation from relevant stakeholders by addressing barriers (e.g., cultural norms or values,\nliteracy levels, language, disabilities, work schedules, childcare) through timing, location, format and\ncommunication strategies.\ne. Defines goals for how the project will support neuro-inclusion through multisensory design strategies.\nf. Identifies a list of credible sources (e.g., interviews, research studies, articles) that support how the identified\nneuro-inclusion goals may be addressed.\ng. Recommends a set of multisensory design strategies to support neuro-inclusion throughout the project.\nNote :\nThis feature is a beta strategy and has an additional documentation requirement (beta feature feedback form). The\nfeedback form supports IWBI in developing new features that are effective and applicable to projects around the\nworld.\nPART 2 CREATE SPACES FOR NEURO-INCLUSION (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\n1: Neuro-inclusive Design\nNote : Projects may only achieve this part if Part 1 is also achieved.\nThe following requirements are met:\na. At least five of the following multisensory design strategies are implemented:\n1. Adjustable environmental factors (e.g., screens, privacy panels, desks, chairs, lighting, temperature, acoustics)\nthat allow people to control their sensory exposure are incorporated throughout.\n2. Natural forms, patterns, lines, shapes and objects (e.g., biomorphic, organic, fractal) are incorporated\nthroughout.\n3. Environmental cues (e.g., visual, tactile, auditory, sensory maps) that indicate a shift in behavior or activity\n4\n9\n3,5\n3,9,20\n1,2,8\n3,6,20\n6,15\n6,10,13\n2,9\n2\n9\n1,8,12\n1,7,8,17\n1,11,12,13\n3,4,10\n3,9\n9\n6,15,18\n5,17,15 \nPage 267 of 282\n© Copyright 2020 International WELL Building Institute, pbc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nbetween spaces are incorporated throughout.\n4. Furniture that allows the body to stay in motion while using (e.g., rocking chair, balance boards).\n5. Movable furniture that can be relocated without causing noise disruption (e.g., placed on soft floor, includes\nfurniture pads) is incorporated throughout.\n6. Enclosed areas that have interior windows providing clear lines of sight throughout the space are\npresent.\n \n7. Walls that are curved or have rounded corners are present.\n8. Single-loaded corridors (i.e., doors to rooms are only located on one side only) are present.\n9. Personal storage for each regular occupant is available.  \n10. At least two entrances to the building are available, one designed with low-stimulation design strategies and\none designed with high-stimulation design strategies.\nb. At least four of the following low-stimulation design strategies are implemented in at least two spaces:\n1. Environmental factors that support visual, auditory and physical privacy.\n2. Areas of refuge.\n3. Low-intensity colors and patterns.\n4. Low-threshold textural experiences (e.g., materials that are smooth or predictable in typography, carpets with\nlow pile).\n5.

Climate change\nas a result of human-caused changes to the environment represents the most existential threat to public health in the next half-century.  Without modifications to the world’s energy\nand agricultural systems, the planet is on track to warm by 3 to 5 degrees by the end of the century.  This change will increase the frequency of extreme weather events, inundate coastal\ncommunities by rising sea levels, and create conditions more conducive to growth of destructive pest organisms, among other perils.  The 2015 Paris Agreement is a legally binding\ninternational treaty involving nearly 200 nations created in an attempt to keep the global rise in temperatures to less than 2 C above pre-industrial levels.  Although some efforts to\nreduce emissions do come at higher initial cost than “business as usual”, the benefits are far higher.  In fact, the co-benefits alone of achieving the target (cleaner air as a result of a shift\naway from fossil fuel) substantially outweighs the cost of change.  In addition to national the goals, many organizations have made their own commitments to change. Many of these are\nmodest,  but others – such as those made in partnership with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – have been evaluated to align with the Paris Agreement goals.  These goals are\noften categorized by their scope, where Scope 1 entails all emissions generated on-site, Scope 2 is all carbon emitted as a result of generating the energy used by the reporting\nentity,  and Scope 3 includes all upstream emissions (from the supply chain), downstream emissions (from use of products), and other indirect emissions (e.g., employee commutes,\nbusiness travel).\nPART 1 ASSESS CARBON EMISSIONS (MAX : 2 PT )\nFor All Spaces:\nA carbon emissions assessment meets the following requirements:\na. Is conducted for the entire organization associated with the property owner, builder, developer or management\ncompany.\nb. Is undertaken in accordance with one of the following:\n1.
